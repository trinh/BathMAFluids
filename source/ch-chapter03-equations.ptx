  <title>Equations of motion</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>In this chapter, we develop the basic equations of fluid dynamics. The equations are derived
      from applying principles of conservation of mass, momentum, and energy. In the simplest
      scenario, this leads to Euler's equation for a perfect (or ideal) fluid. Eventually, we relax
      these assumptions so as to incorporate the effects of viscosity.</p>

    <p> Let <m>D</m> be a region in a 2D or 3D region filled with fluid. The fluid is in motion and
      we wish to describe this motion.</p>

    <p>Let <m>\bx\in D</m> be a point in <m>D</m> and consider the particle of fluid that moves
      through the point <m>\bx</m> at time <m>t</m>. In the figure below, we sketch the trajectory
      that this particle might take within the fluid. Also at the point <m>\bx</m> at time <m>t</m>,
      we let <m>\bu(\bx, t)</m> be the velocity of the particle. At each fixed time, we can imagine
      the velocity vectors drawn at each point in the fluid; thus we call <m>\bu</m> the <em>velocity
      field</em> of the fluid. </p>

      <caption>Image of the fluid domain <m>D</m>.</caption>
      <image source="ch-chapter01-equations-fluid.png" width="50%" />
    </figure>

    <p>At each point in space and moment in time, we assume that the fluid has a well-defined mass
      density, <m>\rho(\bx, t)</m>. Let <m>V \subseteq D</m> be any subregion of <m>D</m>. Then the
      mass of the fluid in <m>V</m> at time <m>t</m> is given by <men xml:id="eqn-mass">
        m(t) = \iiint_{V(t)} \rho(\bx, t) \, \mathrm{d}V.
      </men>
    </p>

    <remark>
      <title>Smoothness and well-posedness</title>
      <p> In most of what follows in this chapter, we shall always assume that the functions <m>
          \bu</m>, <m>\rho</m>, and similarly for others describing fluid quantities are
        sufficiently smooth that the standard calculus operations can be applied to them. <em>Can
          you
          think of some situations in fluid dynamics where smoothness might not be guaranteed?</em>
      </p>
    </remark>

    <remark xml:id="rem-continuum">
      <title>Continuum assumption</title>
      <p> The assumption that the fluid can be described by a smooth scalar density field, <m>\rho</m>,
        is a <em>continuum assumption.</em> This is indeed one of the core assumptions that
        underlies this course, but it is worth noting that this is only an assumption (albeit a
        widely accepted one, applicable to most real-life scenarios). On the other extreme of this
        view is the assumption that the fluid is composed of a discrete set of molecules, all
        bouncing around, and hence fluid dynamics might be posed as the study of the kinetic motion
        of molecules! </p>
      <p> In the continuum description, we are averaging properties (e.g. velocity) over groups of
        individual fluid particles that are close to each other. Thus there is a minimum size of the
        fluid body required for this approach to be valid (if we consider smaller sizes of fluid,
        the motion of individual particles becomes important): <ul>
          <li> For gases at standard temperature and pressure (STP): the minimum volume is around <m>
        10^{-18}</m> m<m>^3=1</m> <m>\mu</m>m<m>^3</m> (this contains around <m>3\times10^7</m>
        molecules).</li>
          <li> For liquids: the minimum volume of fluid is smaller as the particles are closer
        together. For water, the minimum volume is around <m>10^{-21}</m> m<m>^3</m> (this contains
        around <m>3\times10^7</m> molecules).</li>
          <li> For complex fluids: the minimum volume needed to invoke the continuum approximation
        is often larger, e.g. blood contains red blood cells, which significantly affect its
        mechanics (the mechanics of blood plasma approximates that of water) and the volume of a
        single red blood cell is around <m>10^{-16}</m> m<m>^3</m>.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
    </remark>

    <p> In <xref ref="ex-continuum-assumption" />, you will consider whether salt flow can be
      considered under a continuum assumption. </p>

    <p> The derivation of the governing equations for a fluid is then based on three basic
      principles of physics: <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Conservation of mass:</em> mass is neither created nor destroyed. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Conservation of momentum:</em> the rate of change of momentum of a portion of the
      fluid is equal to the applied force (Newton's second law). </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Conservation of energy:</em> energy is neither created nor destroyed. </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>

    <p> Before starting, though, our first task is to derive some helpful results on the
      differentiation of quantities such as <xref ref="eqn-mass" />. </p>

    <title>Reynolds' Transport Theorem</title>

      <title>Jacobian of Lagrangian to Eulerian</title>

      <p> Consider a fluid volume, <m>V \subset D</m>, that is initially dyed a certain colour. The
        packet of fluid is initially located at <m>V(0)</m>. As the fluid evolves in time, it then
        occupies the volume <m>V(t)</m> with <m>t > 0</m>. </p>

      <p> As an example, we may express the density of the fluid as <me>
          \rho = \rho(\bx, t), \qquad \textrm{$\bx \in V(t)$}
        </me> i.e. at every
        point in space and moment in time, the above retrieves the density of the fluid within a
        designated region (which may be changing). This is a natural quantity to study in a fixed
        frame of the fluid. </p>

      <p> Alternatively, we can write <me>
          \rho = \rho(\bX, t), \qquad \textrm{$\bX \in V(0)$}
        </me> which is the
        density of fluid for those particles making up an originally chosen volume, <m>V(0)</m>.
        This is a natural quantity to study if we were to move with the fluid; for instance, if we
        were to colour the volume <m>V(0)</m> with a dye and track its density in time. </p>

      <p> The correspondence between the Euclidean and Lagrangian coordinates is written as <me>
          \bx = \bx(\bX, t).
        </me>
      </p>

      <theorem xml:id="thm-jacobian">
        <title>Jacobian of Lagrangian to Eulerian</title>
        <statement>
          <p>Since we assume the medium is continuous, then we would generally require that the
            mapping from Lagrangian to Eulerian coordinates is continuous and one-to-one; then the
            map assigns every element (label) in the original reference configuration, denoted <m>
            \bX</m>, a unique position, <m>\bx</m>, in the deformed state.</p>

          <p>From Multivariable Calculus, a sufficient condition for this to be true is that the <em>Jacobian
            of the transformation</em>, <me>
              J = \pd{\bx}{\bX} = \pd{(x, y, z)}{(X, Y, Z)} =

              \pd{z}{X} &amp; \pd{z}{Y} &amp; \pd{z}{Z}
              \end{vmatrix}
            </me>
            is finite and non-zero: <me>
              0 \lt J \lt \infty.
            </me>
          </p>
        </statement>
      </theorem>

      <p> The following requires a bit of algebra, and you are not required to prove the result.</p>
      <theorem xml:id="thm-Euleridentity">
        <title>Euler's identity</title>
        <statement>
          <p> The material derivative of the Jacobian of the transformation <m>\bx = \bx(\bX, t)</m>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-RTT">
      <title>Reynolds' Transport Theorem</title>

      <p> We are now ready to derive a key result that eases our path towards developing the
        governing equations for a fluid. The result is as follows.</p>

      <theorem xml:id="thm-RTT">
        <title>Reynolds' Transport Theorem</title>
        <statement>
          <p> Consider a time-dependent volume, <m>V(t)</m>, that is transported by the fluid so
            that it always consists of the same fluid particles. Then, for any function, <m>f(\bx,
              t)</m>, continuously differentiable with respect to its arguments, <em>Reynolds'
            Transport Theorem</em> is as follows: <men xml:id="eqn-RTT">
              \dd{}{t} \iiint_{V(t)} f \, \de{x} \, \de{y} \, \de{z} = \iiint_{V(t)} \left[
              \pd{f}{t} + \nabla \cdot (f\bu)\right] \, \de{x} \, \de{y} \, \de{z}.
            </men>
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p> We transform the integral in Euclidean coordinates to Lagrangian coordinates,
            integrating in the label space: <me>
              I(t) \equiv \iiint_{V(t)} f \, \de{x} \de{y} \de{z}
              = \iiint_{V(0)} f J \, \de{X} \de{Y} \de{Z},
            </me>
            and notice that we now only need to integrate over the fixed volume as defined in
            Lagrangian space, at the expense of adding the Jacobian factor. We now write <md>
              <mrow> \dd{I}{t} &amp;= \iiint_{V(0)} \DD{(fJ)}{t} \, \de{X}\de{Y}\de{Z} </mrow>
            </md>
            and the material derivative passes through since the domain is fixed. The <xref
              ref="thm-material-derivative" /> now allows us to convert the material derivative to
            regular partial derivatives. By the chain rule: <md>
              <mrow>\DD{(fJ)}{t} &amp;= \DD{f}{t}J + f\DD{J}{t} </mrow>
              <mrow> &amp;= \left[ \pd{f}{t} + \bu \cdot \nabla f\right]J
                + f \left[J \nabla \cdot \bu\right] </mrow>
              <mrow> &amp;= \left[ \pd{f}{t} + \nabla \cdot (f\bu) \right]J </mrow>
            </md>
            and we have differentiated the Jacobian via Euler's identity <xref
              ref="thm-Euleridentity" /> in the second line. The last line follows from the chain
            rule applied to the vector identity: <me>
              \nabla \cdot (f\bu) = f \nabla \cdot \bu + \nabla f \cdot \bu.
            </me>
            We can now revert from Lagrangian to Eulerian integration, and this thus completes the
            proof of the Reynolds' Transport Theorem.</p>
        </proof>
      </theorem>

      <note>
        <p>It is helpful for you to convince yourself that the vector identity used in the proof is
          the only possible arrangement of operations that makes sense, i.e. in order for <m>\nabla
          \cdot
            (f\bu)</m> to return a scalar.</p>
      </note>

      <p>In summary: the Reynolds' Transport Theorem thus gives an identity for how time
        differentiation can
        pass through the integral when the domain of integration is changing in time!</p>

      <remark>
        <title>A 1D version of the Reynolds' Transport Theorem</title>
        <p> In 1D, Reynolds' Transport Theorem reduces to an identity known as Leibniz's rule. This
          is presented as an exercise in <xref ref="ex-leibnitz-rule" />. </p>
      </remark>

      <remark>
        <title>RTT and conserved quantities</title>
        <p> Reynolds' Transport Theorem is particularly useful when the integral quantity <me>
            B = \iiint_{V(t)} f \, \de{x} \, \de{y} \, \de{z}
          </me> is a <em>conserved
          quantity</em>. A conserved quantity is something for which we can apply a <em>principle of
          conservation</em>. In practice for this course, this is usually mass or linear momentum: <ul>
            <li>
              <p> Mass: <m>f=\rho</m> and the left-hand side of <xref ref="eqn-RTT" /> is zero
          because mass is conserved. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p> Linear momentum: <m>\bf=\rho\bu</m> is now a vector quantity and, by <em>Newton's
          second law</em>, the left-hand side of <xref ref="eqn-RTT" /> equals the sum of the all
          the forces acting on the fluid in the control volume <m>V</m>, which are: <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p> Surface forces: Forces acting on the surfaces of the fluid, which could be
          reaction forces from the walls of a container, or forces due to pressure or stress from
          surrounding fluid. (Note that we will cover stress in <xref ref="ch-viscousflows" />.) </p>

                      and in this course you will usually only need to consider the force
                      of gravity, although in principle other body forces could act
                      such as an electromagnetic force. In addition, if working in
                      a noninertial frame of reference, other apparent forces need to
                      be added (forces due to linear acceleration, angular acceleration
                      and the Coriolis and centrifugal forces).

        <title>General statement of RTT</title>
        <p>
          <em>Non-examinable:</em>
        </p>

        <p>A more general statement of the Reynolds' Transport Theorem is as follows: We define a <em>control
          volume</em> <m>V(t)</m>. This is a region of the fluid that we specify; it could be any
          fluid-containing volume, and in particular it doesn't need to follow the fluid particles
          (unlike <xref ref="eqn-RTT" />). Then the rate of change of <m>B</m> in the system of
          particles equals the integral of the rate of change of <m>f</m> over the control volume
          plus the net flux of the <m>f</m> through the surface of the control volume: <men
            xml:id="eqn-RTT-simp">
            \dd{B_{\textrm{syst}}}{t} = \dd{B_{CV}}{t}+\dot{B}_{CS}.
          </men>
          Here, <m>B_{\textrm{syst}}</m> is the amount of <m>B</m> in the system of particles, that
          is the Lagrangian derivative of <m>B</m>, <m>B_{CV}</m> is the amount of <m>B</m> in the
          control volume and <m>\dot{B}_{CS}</m> is the flux of <m>B</m> across the surface of the
          control volume. Note that, if <m>B</m> is conserved then we can write the left-hand side
          in terms of other things (zero if <m>B</m> is mass and the sum of the forces if <m>B</m>
          is linear momentum). </p>
        <p> This is in a form that can be used to solve many problems in engineering. The key point
          is that these problems are about quantities on the scale of the <em>control volume</em>
          and not about the details of the flow at particular points. </p>
        <p>
          Thus, for example we could consider a tank with inlets and outlets and,
          using the fluid in the tank as the control volume, we can apply the conservation
          of mass to find the volume flow rates in the inlets and outlets and the level of
          fluid in the tank.
        </p>
        <p>
          We can use momentum conservation to find the force on a section of a pipe
          or the dynamics of a piston moving a fluid to which a known force is applied.

    <title>Conservation of mass</title>

    <introduction>
      <p>
        Our task from this section is to prove the following equation for the conservation of mass
        of a fluid:</p>

      <theorem xml:id="thm-mass">
        <title>Continuity equation</title>
        <statement>
          <p> The differential form of the law of conservation of mass, otherwise known as the <em>continuity
            equation</em> is <men xml:id="eqn-consvmass1">
              \pd{\rho}{t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \bu) = 0,
            </men> where <m>\rho
            = \rho(\bx,t)</m> is the density of the fluid and <m>\bu = \bu(\bx, t)</m> is the
            velocity of the fluid. </p>

          <p> The above form is equivalent, by the definition of the convective derivative, to <men
              xml:id="eqn-consvmass2">
              \DD{\rho}{t} + \rho(\nabla \cdot \bu) = 0.
            </men>

          </p>
        </statement>
      </theorem>

      <p> In fact, as it turns out, the proof of this result is trivial if we use the Reynolds'
        Transport Theorem and Lagrangian formulation following <xref ref="thm-RTT" />.</p>

      <proof>
        <p> We consider the time differentiation of the mass integral, <me>
            \iiint_{V(t)} \rho \, \de{V},
          </me> for an arbitrary material
          volume <m>V(t)</m> in the fluid. </p>


        <p> By <xref ref="thm-RTT" />, we can use the Reynolds' Transport Theorem to pass the time
          derivative through the integral. This gives: <me>
            \dd{}{t}\iiint_{V(t)} \rho \de{V} = \iiint_{V(t)} \left[ \pd{\rho}{t} + \nabla \cdot
          (\rho \bu)\right] \, \de{V},
          </me>
          which is satisfied for any volume <m>V \subseteq D</m> where the fluid is defined. Since
          the result is true for any such possible volume, then the integrand of the right
          hand-side, itself, must be zero. This gives immediately <xref ref="eqn-consvmass1" />. </p>

        Within the above proof, we use an idea used throughout this chapter,

        This is sometimes referred to as the "Bump lemma".

      <title>Derivation of mass conservation using Eulerian methods</title>

      <p> The derivation we have just shown for <xref ref="thm-mass" />, using the Lagrangian
        viewpoint and the Reynolds' Transport Theorem is misleadingly simple, and it can be
        instructive to see how the result is proved purely from the perspective of Eulerian
        coordinates. </p>

      <p> For this, let us consider <m>V</m> to be a <em>fixed and closed</em> subregion of the
        overall fluid, <m>D</m> that does not change with time. An illustration of this is shown in <xref
          ref="fig-normalvolume" />.</p>

      <figure xml:id="fig-normalvolume">
        <caption>Picture of the fluid volume, <m>V</m>, shown in blue, with a small surface element, <m>\partial

          <shortdescription>Fluid</shortdescription>
        </image>
      </figure>

      <p>We want to prove the following result, which essentially equates the change in mass, due to
        density changes, to the flow of mass in or out of the volume.</p>

      <theorem>
        <title>Integral form of the law of conservation of mass</title>

        <statement>
          <p>Given a fixed volume element <m>V</m> and boundary <m>\partial V</m>, the integral form
            of the law of mass conservation is <men xml:id="eqn-integralconservation">
              \dd{}{t} \iiint_V \rho \, \de{V} = -\iint_{\partial V} \rho \bu \cdot \bn \, \de{S}.
            </men>
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p> The rate of change of mass in <m>V</m> is <me>
              \dd{}{t} \iiint_V \rho(\bx, t) \, \de V = \iiint_V \pd{\rho}{t} \, \de V,
            </me>
            and note the derivative passes through the integral since the volume, <m>V</m>, does not
            change with time. </p>
          <p> Let the boundary of <m>V</m> be given by <m>\partial V</m>, and let <m>\bn</m> denote
            the outward unit normal defined along the boundary <m>\partial V</m>. At each point on
            the boundary, the volume flow rate (known as the <em>flux</em>) across the boundary is
            given by <m>\bu
              \cdot \bn</m> and therefore the mass flow rate is <m>\rho \bu \cdot \bn</m>. </p>
          <p> We now sum the total mass flow across the entire boundary. This is given by the
            surface integral <me>
              \text{rate of mass change across $\partial V$} = \iint_{\partial V} \rho \bu \cdot \bn
            \,
              \de{S}.
            </me>
            The flux out of the boundary is also sketched in <xref ref="fig-normalvolume" />. </p>

          <p> Mass conservation is now applied. Therefore, the rate of change of pass in the volume <m>
            V</m> is equal to the rate at which mass enters the boundary in the <em>inwards</em>
            direction. </p>
        </proof>
      </theorem>

      <p> We now want to transform the integral form in <xref ref="eqn-integralconservation" /> into
        the form of a partial differential equation. To do this, apply the <em>Divergence theorem</em>
        to the right hand-side of the above integral, converting the surface integral to a volume
        integral. Moving all quantities to the left hand side now yields <me>
          \iiint_V \left[ \pd{\rho}{t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \bu)\right] \, \de{V} = 0.
        </me>
        Since the above integral equation holds for all possible <m>V</m>, it must be equivalent to
        the integrand equated to zero (<xref ref="lem-bump" />). This yields our final result
        leading to <xref ref="thm-mass" />. </p>

          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p> This proof just follows from expansion. Pass the derivative through the integral and

      <p> With mass conservation now handled, we turn our eyes towards a law that governs the

        Our task from this section is to prove the following equation for the conservation of mass
        of a fluid:</p>

        </statement>
      </theorem>

      <p> Note that above, we have used the notation <m>\nabla \bu</m> for the gradient of a vector.
        This is explained in <xref ref="remark-vector-gradient" />. </p>
    </introduction>

    <subsection>
      <title>Proof of the momentum equation for an inviscid fluid</title>


      <p> Consider again a material volume <m>V(t)</m> of the fluid. Then the rate of change of net
        momentum of this volume is equal to <men xml:id="eqn-momentum1">
          \dd{}{t} \iiint_{V(t)} \rho \bu(\bx, t) \, \de{V}.
        </men> It is helpful
        to remember that the mass of a volume element is <m>\rho \de{V}</m> and the acceleration is <m>
        \dd{\bu}{t}</m>, so the above is similar to mass times acceleration. However, we work with
        the more general form above to allow for changes in the density throughout the fluid, and
        also for variable fluid elements, <m>V(t)</m>. </p>


      <p>
        We must equate the above to the sum of all surface and body forces applied to the fluid
        element.
      </p>

      <p> An example of a body force is the force of gravity. For a small volume element of mass <m>\rho
        \de{V}</m>, the force of gravity is equal to <m>(\rho \de{V})\bg</m>. Therefore, the total
        external force due to gravity on the volume is equal to <men xml:id="eqn-momentum2">
        \iiint_{V} \rho \bg \, \de{V}.
        </men> There may be other external body
        forces. For example, if your fluid is electrically conductive (like a plasma), there may be
        electromagnetic forces that must be considered. In any case, <m>\bg</m> can be considered as
        the analogous body force. </p>

      <p> The final type of forces we should consider are <em>surface forces</em>, which are applied
        to the boundary of the fluid element, denoted <m>\partial V</m>. Let us assume that at each
        point on the boundary, there is a per-surface area surface force, <m>\bF</m>, that
        decomposes into component normal to the boundary, <m>F_n \bn</m>, and a component tangential
        to the boundary, <m>F_t \bt</m>. So the surface forces, summed over the boundary, will be <men
          xml:id="eqn-momentum-force">
          \iint_{\partial V} \left[ F_n \bn + F_t \bt\right] \, \de{S}.
        </men> In
        the above, the interpretation is that the force on a small patch of surface area <m>\de{S}</m>
        is equal to the per-area force, say <m>F_n</m>, multiplied by the area, then directed into
        the normal direction, <m>\bn</m>. </p>

      <p> At this point, we make a key assumption that is applied in the particular case of <em>inviscid
        fluids</em>.</p>

      <theorem xml:id="thm-inviscid-force">
        <title>Forces in inviscid fluids</title>
        <statement>
          <p> In the case of <em>inviscid fluids</em>, we assume that the surface pressure exerted
            on (interior) volume elements is accounted solely by a pressure, <m>p</m>, which acts in
            the inward normal direction at each point, with <m>F_n \bn = -p \bn</m>. Consequently,
            the surface force, given by <xref ref="eqn-momentum-force" />, is <men
              xml:id="eqn-eqn-momentum-pressure">
              \iint_{\partial V} (-p) \bn \, \de{S} = \iiint_V (-\nabla p) \, \de{V}.
            </men>
          </p>
          <p>
            In particular, for the case of inviscid fluids, we ignore tangential internal forces.
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p> The result follows by a corollary of the diverence theorem. The divergence theorem is <me>
            \iiint_V \nabla \cdot \bF \, \de{V} = \iint_{\partial V} \bF \cdot \bn \, \de{S}.
            </me>
            Let <m>\bF = p \boldsymbol{c}</m> where <m>\boldsymbol{c} = [1, 1, 1]</m> and apply to
            the above. </p>
        </proof>
      </theorem>

      <p> Finally, it follows by summation of the forces above that Newton's law states that <me>
        \dd{}{t} \iiint_{V(t)} \rho \bu(\bx, t) \, \de{V} = -\iiint_V (\nabla p) \, \de{V} + \iiint
        \rho \bg \, \de{V}.
        </me>
        We can now use the corollary to the transport theorem <xref ref="cor-convmass" />, with the
        assignment of <m>f = \rho u_x, \rho u_y, \rho u_z</m> and this allows us to the conclude
        that <me>
          \iiint_{V} \left( \rho \DD{\bu}{t} + \nabla p - \rho \bg\right) \, \de{V} = 0.
        </me>
        Again, the above holds for all material volumes <m>V</m> and therefore it must follow that
        the integrand is zero. We conclude thus with the following result as stated in <xref
          ref="thm-momentum" />: <me>
          \rho \DD{\bu}{t} = - \nabla p + \rho \bg.
        </me>

    <subsection>
      <title>Incompressible fluids and the Euler equations</title>


      <p> Recall from <xref ref="thm-Euleridentity" /> that the Jacobian relates infinitessimal
        volumes in Eulerian and Lagrangian frames via <men xml:id="eq-dxyz-Jacobian">
          \dxyz = J \dXYZ
        </men>. So the Jacobian is a measure of the local
        expansion or contraction of a fluid (relative to its original state). If we use Euler's
        identity in the theorem, we are led to an important interpretation for what it means for a
        fluid to satisfy <m>\nabla \cdot \bu = 0</m>. This leads us to defining the notion of an <em>incompressible
        fluid.</em> (You already previously encountered an intuitive definition for an
        incompressible flow as part of <xref ref="ex-video-flow-visualisation" />). </p>

      <theorem xml:id="def-incompressible">
        <title>Incompressible fluids</title>
        <statement>
          <p>A fluid is said to be <em>incompressible</em> if it preserves infinitessimal volumes.
            Since such volumes are related via <xref ref="eq-dxyz-Jacobian" />, then this is
            equivalent to <me>
              \DD{J}{t} \equiv 0,
            </me> within the relevant fluid (and
            temporal) domain.</p>

          <p>The following equivalence (iff) then follows: <men xml:id="eqn-incompressibledef">
            \textrm{Fluid is incompressible} \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad \nabla \cdot \bu = 0.
            </men>
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p> Note that if <m>\DD{J}{t} = 0</m>, then indeed the an infinitessimal volume element
            must be of static volume for all time according to <xref ref="eq-dxyz-Jacobian" />. Then
            by Euler's identity in <xref ref="thm-Euleridentity" />, this implies <m>\nabla \cdot
              \bu = 0.</m> Conversely, if <m>\nabla \cdot \bu = 0</m>, then again by the identity
            the fluid is incompressible. </p>
        </proof>
      </theorem>


      <p> So in conclusion, for the case of an incompressible fluid, it suffices to solve the
        equation <men xml:id="eqn-divu">
          \nabla \cdot \bu = 0,
        </men> instead of the more complicated equation in <xref
          ref="thm-mass" />. </p>

      <p> By the way, what happens to the mass conservation equation in <xref ref="thm-mass" /> if
        the fluid is incompressible? This leads to the following corollary.</p>

      <corollary xml:id="cor-incompressible-density">
        <title>Constant density along streamlines</title>
        <statement>
          <p> For an incompressible fluid, the density is constant along streamlines, i.e. <me>
            \DD{\rho}{t} = \pd{\rho}{t} + (\bu \cdot \nabla)\rho = 0.
            </me>
          </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p> This relies on setting <m>\nabla \cdot \bu = 0</m> in <xref ref="thm-mass" />. </p>
        </proof>
      </corollary>

      <p> Let us return to consider the total sum of equations and unknowns. We have introduced the
        scalar mass conservation equation found in <xref ref="thm-mass" /> (or alternatively the
        more simplified equation <xref ref="eqn-divu" /> for incompressible fluids). Also the vector
        momentum equation found in <xref ref="thm-momentum" />. This yields four scalar equations
        for five unknowns: the pressure <m>p</m>, density <m>\rho</m>, and the three velocity
        components <m>\bu</m>. </p>

      <p> One way of proceeding is to attempt to establish or to inuit a relationship between
        pressure and density. For instance, the assumption of an ideal gas law can be derived from
        kinetic theory, which leads to the empirical law that <m>p = RT\rho</m>, relating pressure
        in a linear fashion to density, and depending on the temperature, <m>T</m>, and a (gas)
        constant <m>R</m>. Other assumptions of the form <m>p = p(\rho)</m> are possible, and this
        is involved in the study of gases and <em>compressible fluids</em>. </p>


      <p>
        However, empirically, we observe that in most liquids, the density only varies within a few
        percent under typical variations of temperature and pressure. Therefore, it is common to
        assume:</p>

      <note>
        <title>Constant density assumption</title>
        <p> We often assume that in the situation of liquids, the density is taken to be constant, <m>\rho
          = \textrm{constant}</m>. </p>
      </note>

      <p> Note, then that in the case of constant density fluids, if we consider the mass
        conservation equation <xref ref="eqn-consvmass1" />, it follows that <m>\nabla \cdot \bu = 0</m>.
        Therefore, from the definition <xref ref="def-incompressible" />, we conclude that the fluid
        is indeed incompressible. </p>

      <remark>
        <p> Confusingly, in many references, authors define a fluid to be incompressible if <m>\rho</m>
          is constant. However, we see this is not necessarily the case. A fluid can be
          incompressible and therefore <m>\DD{\rho}{t} = 0</m> without <m>\rho</m> being constant. </p>
      </remark>

      <p> We are finally ready to state the <em>Euler equations</em>.</p>

      <definition xml:id="def-euler">
        <title>Euler equations</title>

        <statement>
          <p> The <em>Euler equations</em> consist of the continuity equation <xref ref="eqn-divu" />
            and momentum equations <xref ref="eqn-consvmoment" />, considered in the situation of an

              </mrow>
            </mdn>
            Note this is then four scalar equations for the three unknown velocities in <m>\bu</m>
            and pressure <m>p</m>. We shall assume in the course that incompressible fluids have

        surfaces might include the ocean floor bottom and the body of a boat, down to the vegetation
        in the water or the sand on a beach. <em>This can get quite complex!</em> In this module,
        and when we first learn fluid dynamics, we only consider simple bounded fluid regions (fluid
        above a plate, fluid in a box, fluid in a channel, etc.)</p>

      <p>In the case of a water wave, a bounding surface will also include the free surface of the
        wave, itself, which interacts with the surrounding atmospheric gas. This leads to the
        situation of free-boundary or free-surface conditions<idx>
          <h>free-surface</h>
        </idx>. </p>

      <p>
        For the situation of fluid at a solid boundary, this leads us to formulate the following. </p>

      <note xml:id="note-noflux-BC">
        <title>No-flux condition through a boundary</title>
        <p> For a fluid in contact with a fixed rigid boundary, <m>\partial V</m>, then we require
          that the normal velocity of the fluid there must be zero: <men
            xml:id="eqn-motion-noflux-BC">
            <idx>
              <h>boundary conditions, no penetration</h>
            </idx> \bu \cdot \bn = 0 \quad
          \textrm{on $\partial V$}, </men> where <m>\bn</m> is the unit normal to <m>\partial V</m>.
          This condition states that the fluid cannot flow through <m>\partial V</m> or separate
          from <m>\partial V</m> (hence leaving a vacuum). </p>
      </note>

      <p> It turns out that the above no-flux condition is sufficient to provide well-posed boundary
        conditions for most inviscid fluids. Note that in particular, we have not constrained the
        tangential velocity of the fluid, i.e. <m>\bu \cdot \bt</m>, where <m>\bt</m> is the
        tangential vector at the boundary. </p>

      <p> Later in <xref ref="ch-viscousflows" />, you will study the situation of a <em>viscous
        fluid</em>, where it will be important to consider the tangential fluid velocity. </p>

    <title>Bernoulli's equation</title>

    <introduction>

      <p> There is a reformulation of the momentum equations that proves to be useful. In essence,
        it emerges from attempting to integrate the momentum equation <xref ref="eqn-euler-momentum" />
        and yields the famous <em>Bernoulli equation(s)</em>.</p>


      <p>
        We will first need a vector identity.</p>

      <identity xml:id="ident-ugradu">
        <statement>
          <p> Note the following identity: <men xml:id="eqn-ugradu">

            The proof follows from direct expansion of both sides.
          </p>
        </proof>
      </identity>

      <p>
        It will also be useful for us to introduce the notion of vorticity.</p>

      <definition xml:id="def-vorticity">
        <title>Vorticity of a vector field</title>
        <statement>
          <p> The <em>vorticity</em>, <m>\omega</m>, of a vector field is defined by <men
              xml:id="eqn-vorticity">
              \omega \equiv \nabla \times \bu.
            </men> The vorticity is a
            measure of the local rotation of the flow. </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>


      <p> Let us recall the definition of a <em>conservative force</em>.</p>

      <definition xml:id="def-conservative-force">
        <title>Conservative forces</title>
        <statement>
          <p> A force <m>\bF</m> is a <em>conservative force</em> if and only if there exists a
            potential <m>\chi</m>, such that <me>
              \bF = -\nabla \chi,
            </me> in a simply connected region where
            the quantities are defined. </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>

      <p> Note the distinction about a simply-connected neighbourhood. The above is not quite the
        definition of a conservative force (typically defined to be a force for which the work done
        on an object between two points is independent of path). For now, this is not an important
        distinction since we will focus on fluid regions that are free of holes. Until told
        otherwise, we will always assume that the fluid is simply connected and therefore the above
        serves as a definition of conservative forces.
      </p>

      <theorem xml:id="thm-bernoulli-steady">
        <title>Bernoulli's equation for steady flow</title>
        <statement>
          <p>Bernoulli's equation (theorem) for steady flow states that <men
              xml:id="eqn-bernoulli-steady">
              B(\bx) \equiv \frac{p}{\rho} + \frac{1}{2} |\bu|^2 + \chi = \textrm{constant along
            streamlines},
            </men>
            where we have assumed that the body force is <em>conservative</em>, i.e. it can be
            written as <men xml:id="eqn-gravity-potential">
              \bg = -\nabla \chi,
            </men> for a potential function, <m>\chi</m>
            . </p>
        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p> Start from the momentum equation <xref ref="eqn-consvmoment" />, <me>
              \pd{\bu}{t} + \bu \cdot \nabla\bu = - \frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p - \nabla \chi
            </me>
            and use the vector identity <xref ref="eqn-ugradu" /> gives <me>
              \pd{\bu}{t} + (\nabla \times \bu) \times \bu = - \nabla \left(\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p +
            \frac{1}{2} |\bu|^2 + \chi\right).
            </me>
          </p>

          <p> Next, the flow is steady, and therefore we can zero the first term. This leaves <me>
            \bomega \times \bu = -\nabla B.
            </me> We now take the dot
            product of both sides of the equation with <m>\bu</m>. We use the fact that, <me>
              \bu \cdot (\bomega \times \bu ) = 0,
            </me> since it is a
            triple scalar product with two repeated entries. It therefore results in the fact that <me>
            \bu \cdot \nabla B = 0.
            </me> Notice that this is the steady
            component that comes from the material derivative, <m>\DD{B}{t} = 0</m>. So we conclude
            that <m>B</m> is constant along streamlines of the flow. </p>

          <p> It is useful to note that if we use the definition of vorticity in <xref
              ref="eqn-vorticity" />, and the definition of <m>B</m> in <xref
              ref="eqn-bernoulli-steady" />, we have from the above that <men
              xml:id="eqn-bernoulli-vorticity">
              \pd{\bu}{t} + \bomega \times \bu = -\nabla B,
            </men> a form
            that will be useful, shortly. </p>
        </proof>
      </theorem>

      <remark>
        <p> For the typical gravity force directed in the <m>-z</m> direction, we can write <m>\bg =
          -g[0, 0, 1] = -g \be_z</m>. So in this case, the (gravitational) potential is <m>\chi = gz</m>
          . </p>
      </remark>

      <p> The proof of <xref ref="thm-bernoulli-steady" /> introduced a useful form of the momentum
        equation using the vorticity function, resulting in <xref ref="eqn-bernoulli-vorticity" />.
        This leads to the so-called <em>vorticity equation</em> form of the momentum equation.</p>

      <theorem xml:id="thm-vorticity-equation">
        <title>The vorticity equation for incompressible flow</title>
        <statement>
          <p> The momentum equation for incompressible flow, reposed in terms of the vorticity is: <men
              xml:id="eqn-vorticity-equation">
              \pd{\bomega}{t} + (\bu \cdot \nabla)\bomega = (\bomega \cdot \nabla)\bu,

            or, equivalently, <men xml:id="eqn-vorticity-equation-lagrange">
              \DD{\bomega}{t} = (\bomega \cdot \nabla)\bu,
            </men> and is
            known as the <em>vorticity equation</em>. </p>
        </statement>
      </theorem>

      <p> In the proof, it is useful to use the vector identity for the curl of a cross product: <men
          xml:id="eqn-curlcross">
          \nabla \times (\bu \times \bv) = (\nabla \cdot \bv)\bu - (\nabla \cdot \bu)\bv + (\bv
          \cdot \nabla)\bu - (\bu \cdot \nabla)\bv.
        </men>
      </p>


      <proof>
        <p> Crucially, we recall the result that "curl grad equals zero" for a vector field. So from <xref
            ref="eqn-bernoulli-vorticity" />, we take the curl of both sides to obtain <me>
            \nabla \times \left(\pd{\bu}{t} + \bomega \times \bu\right) = 0.
          </me>
          Expanding the outer cross product, the first term can be simplified by swapping
          differentiation in space with differentiation in time. The second term requires the cross
          product identity <xref ref="eqn-curlcross" />. For the second term, we get <me>
            -\nabla \times (\bu \times \bomega) = 0 - 0 + (\bomega \cdot \nabla)\bu - (\bu \cdot
          \nabla)\bomega,
          </me>
          with the first zero resulting in the fact that "div curl equals zero", while the second
          results from incompressibility. </p>

        <p> Thus we have, <me>
            \pd{\bomega}{t} + (\bu \cdot \nabla)\bomega = (\bomega \cdot \nabla)\bu,
          </me>
          which is the main result. </p>
      </proof>

      <p> You will prove this result from first principles in <xref ref="ex-vorticity-equation" />. </p>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-potential">
      <title>Potential flow</title>

      <p> We are interested in the simplest scenarios that will result in reducing the governing

        Euler equations in <xref ref="def-euler" /> and in particular, the reduction of the mass
        conservation equation to <m>\nabla \cdot \bu = 0</m>. </p>

      <p> We attempt to reduce further by assuming that the fluid is <em>irrotational</em>. This

          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>

      <p>
        For an irrotational and incompressible flow, there is a more powerful version of Bernoulli's
        equation.

      <theorem xml:id="thm-bernoulli-potential">
        <title>Bernoulli's equation for steady irrotational flow</title>

        </statement>

        <proof>
          <p> The proof of this relies on returning to the proof of the unsteady Bernoulli's
            equation in <xref ref="thm-bernoulli-steady" />. In the proof, we arrived at the result

            </me> For
            steady flow, the first term disappears. If we have the additional assumption that the

            \nabla B = 0.

        <p> Domestic salt flows quite well out of a container with a hole in the bottom. Following <xref

      <solution>
        <p> Salt is not like a fluid because you can make it into a pile, whereas the surface of a
          resting fluid is always horizontal. However, some aspects of salt flow are similar to the
          flow of a fluid. A typical salt particle is approximately a cube of side <m>0.5</m> mm,
          and therefore has a volume of approximately <m>10^{-10}</m> m<m>^3</m>. We need a size of
          hole that admits a very large number of particles. A reasonable value of the volume <m>V</m>

  <exercise xml:id="tank-filling">
    <p>
      The tank shown in the diagram below has cross-sectional area <m>A</m>
      and height <m>H</m> and has an inlet at the top left and an outlet halfway
      up on the right-hand side.

        </image>
      </figure>
      Starting from empty, the tank is filled with constant volumetric flux <m>Q</m>
      of water through the inlet, and during filling the water level is at
      height <m>h(t)</m>. There are three phases during the filling:
    <ol>
      <li>The first phase when the level in the tank is lower than the outlet pipe,
        and therefore there is inflow and no outflow;</li>
      <li>The second phase when the water level is above that of the outflow but the
        tank is not full, so there is inflow and outflow (but the outflow must be less
        than the inflow so that the tank continues to fill);</li>
      <li>When the tank is full, the inflow equals the outflow.</li>
    </ol>
    During Phase (ii) you may assume that the flow through the outlet is proportional to the depth of
    fluid above the outlet, that is, the volumetric flux through the outlet is <m>k(h - H/2)</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In this question you will find the depth <m>h(t)</m> of the water in the tank over time.
  </p>
  <p>
  <ol>        
    <li>
      <p>
        Use the Reynolds' Transport Theorem to find the depth of water in the tank during Phase (i).
    <solution>
      <p>
        We define the control volume <m>V(t)</m> to be the volume of water in the tank and apply
        mass conservation to the system of particles. We set <m>f=\rho</m> to be the mass per unit
        volume, so that
        <me>\iiint_Vf \, \de{x} \, \de{y} \, \de{z}</me>
        is the mass of fluid in the tank. Since the mass 
        We use the Reynolds' Transport Theorem <xref ref="eqn-RTT"/>. The left-hand side equals zero
        by mass conservation. Hence
        <me>
          0 = \iiint_{V(t)} \left[\pd{f}{t} + \nabla \cdot (f\bu)\right] \, \de{x} \, \de{y} \, \de{z}.
        </me>
        <me>
          0 = \frac{dV_{CV}}{dt} + Q_{CS} = \frac{dV_{CV}}{dt} + Q_{\textrm{outlet}} - Q_{\textrm{inlet}}.
        </me>
        Since the fluid is incompressible we can use volume conservation
        instead of mass conservation.
        During Phase (i), <m>Q_{\text{outlet}} = 0</m> and <m>Q_{\text{inlet}} = Q</m>, so
      </p>
      <me>0 = \frac{dV_{CV}}{dt} - Q</me>
      <p>
        Substituting <m>V_{CV} = Ah</m>, where <m>h(t)</m> is the depth of fluid at time <m>t</m>, we get
      </p>
      <me>h = \frac{Qt}{A}</me>
    </solution>
  </task>

  <task>
    <statement>At what time does Phase (ii) start?</statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        The outlet is reached when <m>h = H/2</m>, which happens at time <m>t = \tfrac{AH}{2Q}</m>, the
    beginning of Phase (ii).
      </p>
    </solution>
  </task>

  <task>
    <statement>Find the height <m>h(t)</m> in the tank during Phase (ii).</statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        We apply the RTT as before, so
      </p>
      <me>0 = \frac{dV_{CV}}{dt} + Q_{\text{outlet}} - Q_{\text{inlet}}</me>
      <p>
        but now <m>Q_{\text{outlet}} = k(h - H/2)</m>. Hence
      </p>
      <me>
        \frac{dh}{dt} + \frac{k}{A}h = \frac{1}{A}\left(Q + \tfrac{kH}{2}\right)
      </me>
      <p>
        Solving with integrating factors gives
      </p>
      <me>
        h = \frac{Q}{k} + \frac{H}{2} + c e^{-kt/A}
      </me>
      <p>
        where <m>c</m> is a constant of integration. Noting that <m>h = H/2</m> at <m>t = AH/2Q</m> gives
    <m>c = -\tfrac{Q}{k} e^{kH/2Q}</m>, and thus
      </p>
      <me>
        h = \frac{H}{2} + \frac{Q}{k}\left(1 - e^{kH/2Q} e^{-kt/A}\right)
      </me>
    </solution>
  </task>

  <task>
    <statement>Assuming that <m>k</m> is small enough that the tank actually fills, how long does Phase
    (ii) last?</statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Phase (ii) ends when the tank is full, that is <m>h = H</m>, which implies
      </p>
      <me>
        t = \frac{AH}{2Q} - \frac{A}{k} \ln\left(1 - \frac{kH}{2Q}\right)
      </me>
      <p>
        Thus Phase (ii) lasts for a time <m> -\tfrac{A}{k} \ln(1 - kH/(2Q))</m>.
      </p>
    </solution>
  </task>

  <task>
    <statement>What is the largest possible value of <m>k</m> so that the tank fills?</statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        We require <m>kH/(2Q) &lt; 1</m>. Thus the largest value of <m>k</m> is <m>2Q/H</m>.
      </p>

    </solution>
  </task>

  <task>
    <statement>
      Once the tank reaches the end of Phase (ii), the pressure suddenly rises so as to drive the
    required flow rate <m>Q</m> out of the tank during Phase (iii).
      What height of the fluid in the tank would cause this outflow if it were not forced (that is, if
    the tank were much taller)?
      Where does the force come from that causes this pressure rise?
    </statement>
    <solution>
      <p>
        Let the unknown height be <m>H_0</m>. We require <m>Q = k(H_0 - H/2)</m>, meaning that the required
    height is <m>H_0 = Q/k + H/2</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the tank is full, the pressure in it can rise arbitrarily, because there is no longer
    atmospheric air in it. The pressure in the inlet needs to rise to create the extra pressure
    within the tank.

        <solution>
          <p> The fluid has a uniform velocity, which means that all components of <m>\nabla\bu</m>

    <exercise xml:id="ex-bernoulli-streamline">
      <title>Using streamlines: The clepsydra</title>
      <introduction>
        <p> One of the earliest means for measuring the passage of time, invented by the ancient
          Egyptians, was the <term>clepsydra</term> (or ‘water thief’): a large jar with a hole in
          its base is filled with water. The shape of the jar was such that the interval of time
          taken for the water surface to pass two equally-spaced markers on the side of the jar is
          constant. </p>

        <figure xml:id="fig-clepsydra">
          <caption>Clepsyndra</caption>
          <image source="clepsydra.png" width="50%">
            <shortdescription>clepsyndra</shortdescription>
          </image>
        </figure>

        <p> In this question you will determine the shape of jar required to achieve this. In
          particular, we denote the (axisymmetric) jar radius a height <m>z</m> above the hole by <m>r
          = a(z)</m>. The radius of the hole, <m>a_h \ne a(0)</m>, in general. </p>
      </introduction>

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>Explain why the curve <m>r = a(z)</m> is a streamline.</p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p> The fluid velocity at the surface of the jar satisfies <m>\bu\cdot\bn=0</m>, so that
            no fluid leaves or enters the jar through its sides. Thus, <me>
              \bu \cdot \bn = u_r - u_z \pd{a}{z} = 0.
            </me> This is
            precisely the condition for <m>r = a(z)</m> to be a streamline. </p>
        </solution>
      </task>

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p> If the surface of the water lies at <m>z = h(t)</m>, use an appropriate form of
            Bernoulli’s principle to calculate the speed of liquid, <m>u</m>, leaving the jar at <m>z
            = 0</m>. </p>
          <p> [You may assume that the desired surface speed <m>u_S = |\dot{h}| \ll u</m>, so that
            the flow is approximately steady and that the fluid pressure is atmospheric at <m>z = 0</m>
            .] </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p> We apply Bernoulli's equation to equate the energy at a point at the edge of the free
            surface at <m>z = h(t)</m> and the fluid leaving the hole at <m>z = 0</m>. At the free
            surface, the pressure is atmospheric, <m>p = p_{atm}</m>, and the speed is <m>
            u_S\sqrt{1+a^{'2}}</m>. At the hole, the pressure is also atmospheric, <m>p = p_{atm}</m>,
            and the velocity is <m>u</m>. Thus, Bernoulli's equation for the streamline joining the
            two points gives <me>
              \frac{p_{atm}}{\rho} + \frac12 u_S^2(1+a^{'2}) + gh = \frac{p_{atm}}{\rho} + \frac12
            u^2.
            </me>
            Assuming that <m>u_S \ll u</m>, this simplifies to <me>
              gh = \frac12 u^2.
            </me>
          </p>
        </solution>
      </task>

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p> Use the principle of conservation of mass to link <m>u_S</m>, <m>u</m>, <m>a_h</m> and <m>
            a(h(t))</m>; thereby determine the correct shape for a clepsydra. </p>
        </statement>

        <solution>
          <p> The volume flux out of the hole is <m>\pi a_h^2 u</m>, while the rate of decrease of
            the volume of fluid in the jar is <m>\pi a(h(t))^2 u_S</m>. Conservation of mass
            therefore gives <me>
              \pi a^2 u_S = \pi a_h^2 u,
            </me> or <me>
              u_S = \frac{a_h^2}{a^2}u.
            </me> Using the result from part
            (b) to eliminate <m>u</m> gives <me>
              u_S = \frac{a_h^2}{a^2}\sqrt{2gh}.
            </me> We require <m>u_S</m>
            to be independent of time so that equally spaced intervals are traversed in equal times.
            Hence, <me>
              a=\left(\frac{a_h^2\sqrt{2g}}{u_S}\right)^{1/2} h^{1/4}.
            </me>
            The terms in the brackets are constant, so we have that the radius of the jar must vary
            as the fourth root of the height. </p>
