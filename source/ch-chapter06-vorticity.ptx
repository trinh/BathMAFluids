  <title>Vortex motion</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>In this chapter, we will study the motion of vortices in an inviscid fluid.
      We will define vortex lines, which are to the vorticity field as the streamlines defined in
      <xref ref="ch-chapter02-kinematics"/> are to the velocity field. We will show that vortex
      lines move with the fluid and that a fluid that starts irrotational remains irrotational
      for all time.

    <p>
      Examples of vortex motion abound in nature and industry. The most familiar examples are perhaps
      tornadoes and hurricanes, which are large-scale vortices in the atmosphere. Other
      examples include the swirling motion that forms when water drains from a bath or
      sink, the wake vortices that form behind aircraft wings, and the vortices that form
      behind a swimming fish or a flying bird. Vortices are also important in engineering
      applications, for example in the design of aircraft wings and turbine blades.

    <p>Recall the fluid vorticity <m>\bomega=\nabla\times\bu</m> that was introduced in
      Definition <xref ref="def-vorticity"/>. Many people struggle to understand the
      concept of vorticity when they first encounter it, so you should not worry if it
      takes a while to sink in. The excellent (although dated) movie `Vorticity, Part 1â€™
      by Ascher Shapiro available at
      <url href="https://web.mit.edu/hml/ncfmf.html" visual="National Committee for Fluid Mechanics Films">this website</url>
      gives a clear and comprehensive introduction to the phenomenon. To recap:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Vorticity, <m>\bomega</m>, is a vector field and it is a function of space and time
            (like the fluid velocity).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            At each point in the fluid, <m>\bomega</m> points in the direction of the axis of the local fluid rotation.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            The magnitude of <m>\bomega</m> is twice the local angular velocity.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            In the special case of a two-dimensional flow
            (that is <m>\bu(\bx,t)=(u(x,y,t),v(x,y,t),0)</m>), the vorticity is
            unidirectional, pointing in the <m>z</m>-direction with
            magnitude <me>\pd{v}{x}-\pd{u}{y}</me>.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

     <example>
      <statement>
        <p> Consider the steady two-dimensional flow given by <me>\bu = (-y,x, 0)</me>, which is flow
          anti-clockwise around the origin. Note that this flow is a type of <em>rigid body rotation</em>:
          it is the flow that would be generated by a rigid body rotating about the <m>z</m>-axis
          with angular velocity <m>1</m>.

              <p>
                Plot the streamlines of this flow.

            <li>
              <p>
                Convert this flow to plane polar coordinates <m>(r,\theta)</m> (where
                <m>x = r\cos\theta</m> and <m>y = r\sin\theta</m>), and show that the <m>r</m>-component
                of the velocity is zero and the <m>\theta</m>-component is <m>1</m>.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Hence find the angular velocity of the fluid.

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Calculate the vorticity of the flow.

          <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                The streamlines are concentric circles around the origin, with flow going anticlockwise
                around the circles.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                We have
                <me>\dd{r}{t}=\frac{x}{r}(-y)+\frac{y}{r}(x)=0,</me>
                and
                <md>
                  <mrow>\dd{\theta}{t}\amp=\dd{}{t}\left(\tan^{-1}\frac{y}{x}\right)</mrow>
                  <mrow>\amp=\frac{1}{1+y^2/x^2}\left(-\frac{y}{x^2}\right)(-y)+\frac{1}{1+y^2/x^2}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)(x)</mrow>
                  <mrow>\amp=1.</mrow>
                </md>
                  Thus, in plane polar coordinates, the velocity is <m>(0,1)</m>.
                </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                The angular velocity is everywhere <m>(0,0,1)</m>.

            <li>
              <p>
                The vorticity of the flow is given by
                <me>
              \bomega = \bnabla\times\bu
              = \begin{vmatrix}

              -y \amp x \amp 0
              \end{vmatrix}
              = (0,0,2),
            </me>
            which is twice the local angular momentum
            (magnitude twice the rotation rate, with axis in the direction of the axis of rotation).

<section xml:id="sec-helmholtz">
    <title>The Helmholtz principle</title>
      <p>As mentioned in Chapter <xref ref="ch-chapter03-equations"/>, the vorticity obeys the
      vorticity equation <xref ref="eqn-vorticity-equation-lagrange"/>:
      <me>
        \DD{\bomega}{t} = (\bomega \cdot \nabla)\bu.
      </me>
      In two-dimensional irrotational flow, the right-hand side is zero, so the vorticity of each fluid
      particle is constant in time. This is a special case of the more general result known as
      the <em>Helmholtz principle</em>, which states that in an inviscid fluid, the vorticity
      of each fluid particle is conserved.
