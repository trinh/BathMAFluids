  <title>Vortex motion</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this chapter, we will study the motion of vortices in an inviscid fluid.
      We will define vortex lines, which are to the vorticity field as the streamlines defined in
      <xref ref="ch-chapter02-kinematics"/> are to the velocity field. We will show that vortex
      lines move with the fluid and that a fluid that starts irrotational remains irrotational
      for all time.

    <p>
      Examples of vortex motion abound in nature and industry. The most familiar examples are perhaps
      tornadoes and hurricanes, which are large-scale vortices in the atmosphere. Other
      examples include the swirling motion that forms when water drains from a bath or
      sink, the wake vortices that form behind aircraft wings, and the vortices that form
      behind a swimming fish or a flying bird. Vortices are also important in engineering
      applications, for example in the design of aircraft wings and turbine blades.

    <title>Vorticity and circulation</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        The fluid vorticity <m>\bomega=\nabla\times\bu</m> was introduced in
        <xref ref="def-vorticity"/>. Many people struggle to understand the
        concept of vorticity when they first encounter it, so you should not worry if it
        takes a while to sink in. The excellent (although dated) movie `Vorticity, Part 1’
        by Ascher Shapiro available at
        <url href="https://web.mit.edu/hml/ncfmf.html" visual="National Committee for Fluid Mechanics Films">this website</url>
        gives a clear and comprehensive introduction to the phenomenon. To recap:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Vorticity, <m>\bomega</m>, is a vector field and it is a function of space and time
              (like the fluid velocity).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              At each point in the fluid, <m>\bomega</m> points in the direction of the axis of the local fluid rotation.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The magnitude of <m>\bomega</m> is twice the local angular velocity.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In the special case of a two-dimensional flow
              (that is <m>\bu(\bx,t)=(u(x,y,t),v(x,y,t),0)</m>), the vorticity is
              unidirectional, pointing in the <m>z</m>-direction with
              magnitude <me>\pd{v}{x}-\pd{u}{y}</me>.

        particle is constant in time. This is a special case of the more general result known as

          This theorem explains why the circulation is an important physical concept.
          In particular, if a flow is initally irrotational,
          then the circulation around any loop is zero at <m>t=0</m>.
          The theorem then implies that the circulation around any loop is zero for all time.

                and the vortex tube moves with the flow. The surfaces of the vortex tube are vortex lines.
                This is a strong part of the reason why it is useful to calculate vortex lines.

        <title>Proof of the Helmholtz vortex theorems</title>
        <p>
          <em>Proof of the first vortex theorem.</em>
          For a given vortex line, choose two vortex surfaces containing the line
          such that the vortex line is the intersection of the two vortex surfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Choose a closed curve <m>C</m>
          lying within one the vortex surfaces.
          The circulation around <m>C</m> is
          <me>
            \Gamma=\oint_C\bu\cdot\de\bx=\iint_S\bomega\cdot\bn\,\de S,
          </me>
          where the final equality is by Stokes' theorem. Since the curve is within the
          vortex surface, the vorticity is parallel to the surface, and hence
          <m>\bomega\cdot\bn=0</m>. Thus <m>\Gamma=0</m>, and by
          <xref ref="thm-kelvin-circulation-theorem"/>, <m>\Gamma</m>
          must remain at zero for all times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus at time <m>t</m>, the evolved surface has circulation zero for all closed
          curves, and therefore by Stokes' theorem, the integral of <m>\bomega\cdot\bn</m>
          over any sub-surface must be zero. Hence <m>\bomega\cdot\bn=0</m> at all points
          on the surface, meaning that the vorticity is everywhere parallel to the evolved
          surface. This means that the evolved surface must be a vortex surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recall that any vortex line can be defined by the intersection of two vortex
          surfaces. Let the two surfaces evolve and the evolution of the vortex line
          remains as the intersection of the two evolved vortex surfaces. As proven
          already, the vorticity is everywhere parallel to the two evolved vortex surfaces
          and thus it is parallel to the evolved vortex line. This means that it remains
          as a vortex line.
        </p>
        <p>
          This completes the proof of the first vortex theorem:
          vortex lines evolve with the fluid.
          We sometimes say that the vortex lines are `frozen' in the fluid,
          meaning that the evolve in the same way as a dye `frozen' into the fluid would.

        <p>
          <em>Proof of the second vortex theorem.
          Proof that <m>\Gamma</m> is the same for all cross-sections.</em>
          To prove the second vortex theorem, choose two different cross-sections of the
          vortex tube, <m>S_1</m> and <m>S_2</m> say, and consider the section <m>V</m>
          of the vortex tube lying between <m>S_1</m> and <m>S_2</m>. We integrate over
          the surface of <m>V</m>:
          <me>
            \iint_{\partial V}\bomega\cdot\bn\de S
            =\iint_{S_2}\bomega\cdot\bn\de S
            -\iint_{S_1}\bomega\cdot\bn\de S
            +\iint_{\mathrm{outside}}\bomega\cdot\bn\de S,
          </me>
          where `outside' refers to the outer surface of the vortex tube between
          <m>S_1</m> and <m>S_2</m>. Since vortex lines are paralled to this surface,
          we have <m>\bomega\cdot\bn=0</m> there, and so
          <me>
            \iint_{\partial V}\bomega\cdot\bn\de S
            =\iint_{S_2}\bomega\cdot\bn\de S
            -\iint_{S_1}\bomega\cdot\bn\de S.
          </me>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, by the divergence theorem,
          <me>
            \iint_{\partial V}\bomega\cdot\bn\de S
            =\iiint_V\nabla\cdot\omega \de V,
          </me>
          but this equals zero, since <m>\nabla\cdot\omega=0</m>
          (divergence of a curl is zero).
        </p>
        <p>
          Putting this together,
          <me>
            \iint_{\partial V}\bomega\cdot\bn\de S
            =\iint_{S_2}\bomega\cdot\bn\de S
            -\iint_{S_1}\bomega\cdot\bn\de S
            =0.
          </me>
          and this was true for any choice of <m>S_1</m> and <m>S_2</m>.
          Hence, <m>\Gamma</m> is the
          same for all cross-sections of a vortex tube.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Proof of the second vortex theorem (continued).
          Proof that <m>\Gamma</m> is independent of time.</em>
          To prove that <m>\Gamma</m> is independent of time, we note that, since the
          vortex lines move with the fluid, the vortex tube also moves with the fluid,
          being composed of vortex lines, and the same vortex lines lie on the surface
          and are enclosed within the vortex tube for all time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover,
          <me>
            \Gamma=\iint\omega\cdot\bn\de S
            =\oint\bu\cdot\de\bx
          </me>
          by Stokes' theorem, which is the circulation around the boundary of <m>S</m>.
          As the tube evolves, the material surface <m>S</m> moves with the vortex tube.
          By <xref ref="thm-kelvin-circulation-theorem"/>, <m>\Gamma</m> remains
          independent of <m>t</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
      <remark>
        <p>
          The second theorem shows us that if a vortex tube becomes stretched
          then by mass conservation, it must get thinner.
          The flux of vorticity along the vortex tube is given by
          <m>\Gamma=\int_S\bomega\cdot{\bn}\,dS</m>, and this must remain constant,
          and therefore, since the area of the cross-section <m>S</m> is decreasing,
          the magnitude of vorticiy  <m>\bomega</m> must increase in the tube.
          This is <em>spin up</em>.
          Conversely, if a vortex tube becomes shorter,
          we get the opposite effect of <em>spin down</em>
          and <m>\bomega</m> gets smaller.

          A non-fluids example of the same principle can be seen when dancers perform
          moves involving spins,
          especially ice skaters,
          the dance starts rotating with their arms or legs out, and
          then they pull in to speed up the spin.

          show examples of spin up and spin down, respectively.
          Spin up occurs in thunderstorms; as the cloud moves, the vortex lines get stretched,
          and this can result in a tornado. Spin up happens in a cup of tea after it has been stirred.
          Secondary flows in the cup tend to spread the column of rotating fluid horizontally,
          making the area of the cross-section of the vortex tube bigger,
          and hence the vorticity smaller, which is spin down.

          The Helmholtz vertex theorems help us to understand the concept of a
          line vortex in irrotational flow that was introduced in
          <xref ref="example-streamfunction-linevortex"/>. Recall that this
          is associated with the complex potential

            u = -\frac{\Gamma y}{2\pi(x^2+y^2)},\quad

          A flow with a line vortex has an infinite concentration of vortex lines
          along the axis of the line vortex. By the first vortex theorem

            At take-off, an aircraft generates strong vortices shed from the tips of
            its wings, see <xref ref="fig-wingtip-vortices"/>.
            These are observed to move downwards and outwards under each other's influence.
          </p>
          <p>
            At a busy airport, a delay is required between the take off of one aircraft and the next
            in order for the wing tip vortices generated from the take off of the first
            aircraft to move away and break up.
            The time required for this to happen depends on the size and speed of the aircraft,
            as well as the angle of attack of the wings, but it is typically 2 or 3 minutes.
            This need for a delay is the main reason that a given airport runway can only
            take so many aeroplanes
            per day, limiting the flight volume of the airport.

            \Gamma = \oint_{C} \mathbf{u} \cdot \de\mathbf{x}.

          remains irrotational for all time.

          Note that this is a key result: if a flow is initially irrotational,
          it remains so indefinitely and we can introduce a velocity potential
          <m>\phi</m> such that <m>\mathbf{u} = \nabla \phi</m>.

          Assuming a conservative body force <m>-\bnabla\chi</m> per unit volume,
          the Euler equation reads
          <me>
            \DD{\bu}{t}=-\bnabla\left(\frac{p}{\rho}-\chi\right),
          </me>
          <md>
            <mrow>\left.\bu\cdot\de\bx\right|_{t+\de t}\amp=\bu(\bx+\bu(\bx,t)\de t,t+\de t)\cdot\left((\bx+\de\bx+\bu(\bx+\de\bx,t)\de t)-(\bx+\bu(\bx,t)\de t)\right)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=\left(\bu(\bx,t)-\bnabla\left(\frac{p}{\rho}-\chi\right)\de t\right)\cdot\left(\de\bx+(\de\bx\cdot\bnabla)\bu\de t\right)</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=\left.\bu\cdot\de\bx\right|_{t}+\left(\bu\cdot(\de\bx\cdot\bnabla)\bu-\bnabla\left(\frac{p}{\rho}-\chi\right)\cdot\de\bx\right)\de t.</mrow>
          </md>
          Hence
          <md>
            <mrow>\dd{\Gamma}{t}\amp=\lim_{\de t\rightarrow0}\frac1{\de t}\oint_C\left(\bu\cdot(\de\bx\cdot\bnabla)\bu-\bnabla\left(\frac{p}{\rho}-\chi\right)\cdot\de\bx\right)\de t</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=\oint_C\bu\cdot(\de\bx\cdot\bnabla)\bu-\bnabla\left(\frac{p}{\rho}-\chi\right)\cdot\de\bx</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=\oint_C\bnabla\left(\frac12\bu^2\right)\cdot\de\bx-\bnabla\left(\frac{p}{\rho}+\chi\right)\cdot\de\bx</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=\oint_C\bnabla\left(\frac12\bu^2-\frac{p}{\rho}-\chi\right)\cdot\de\bx</mrow>
            <mrow>\amp=0.</mrow>
          </md>
          The final equality above follows because the line integral of a gradient around a closed curve is zero.
          Thus <m>\Gamma</m> is independent of <m>t</m>.
          If the flow is initially irrotational, then <m>\Gamma=0</m> at <m>t=0</m>
          for any closed curve <m>C(0)</m>, and hence <m>\Gamma=0</m> for all time.
          Since this holds for any closed curve, it follows that <m>\omega=\bnabla\times\bu=0</m> for all time.
