  <title>Potential flows</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>Typically, the most basic introduction on fluid dynamics usually involves the study of two-dimensional incompressible and irrotational flows, otherwise known as <em>potential flows</em>. There is a good reason for this: the theory is elegant, visualisable, and uses to its benefit the enormous power of complex-variable theory. </p>
  </introduction>

<section xml:id="sec-Potential-and-streamfunction">
  <title>The velocity potential</title>


  <p>
    In this chapter, we focus on 2D flows where the velocity vector is given by 
    <me>
      \bu(x, y, t) = u(x, y, t)\bi + v(x, y, z)\bj = [u, v].
    </me>
    With the velocity given as above, the vorticity is then 
    <men xml:id="eqn-2d-vorticity">
      \bomega = \nabla \times \bu = \left(\pd{v}{x} - \pd{u}{y}\right)\bk.
    </men>
    If we assume that the flow is irrotational according to <xref ref="def-irrotational"/>, then <m>\nabla \times \bu = 0</m> and 
    <men xml:id="eqn-2d-irrotational">
      \pd{v}{x} - \pd{u}{y} = 0.
    </men>
  </p>

  <p>
    Further, we know that if the flow is irrotational, then there exists a <em>velocity potential</em>, <m>\phi</m>, such that <m>\bu = \nabla \phi</m>. Thus the velocities are expressed as 
    <men xml:id="eqn-vel-potential">
      u = \pd{\phi}{x} \quad \textrm{and} \quad v = \pd{\phi}{y}.
    </men>
  </p>

  <p>
    The above result about irrotational flows is a standard result in Vector Calculus, but we will re-state the result here for reference, and provide a review of its proof. 

    <theorem xml:id="thm-exist-potential">
      <title>Existence of a potential</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider a three-dimensional time-dependent velocity field, <m>\bu = \bu(\bx, t)</m> defined on a simply connected domain <m>\bx\in D \subset \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^+.</m>
        </p>
          
          <p>Then <m>\bu</m> is irrotational, i.e. <m>\nabla \times \bu = 0</m> if and only if there exists a scalar potential, defined on <m>D \times \mathbb{R}^+</m>, such that <m>\bu = \nabla \phi</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <p>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Define 
          <me>
            \phi(\bx, t) \equiv \phi_0(t) + \int_C \bu \cdot \de{x},
          </me>
          where <m>C</m> is any contour connecting an arbitrary origin point to the point <m>\bx</m> (changing the origin point will change the "constant" of integration <m>\phi_0(t)</m>).
        </p>

        <p>
          We can verify, using the definition of differentiation, and the fundamental theorme of calculus, applied along each of the three coordinate directions, that <m>\nabla \phi = \bu</m> as desired. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The key is to prove that the above definition is unique, regardless of the choice of contour <m>C</m>. To this end, consider two contours, <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m>, both with the same origin point, <m>O</m>, and end point <m>P</m>. Then the contour <m>C_1 - C_2</m> is a close contour beginning and ending at <m>O</m>. 
        </p>

        <figure xml:id="fig-potential-proof">
          <caption>Proof of the uniqueness of the potential</caption>
          <image source="potentialproof.jpg" width="80%"/>
        </figure>

        <p>
          By Stokes' theorem, 
          <me>
            \int_{C_1 - C_2} \bu \cdot \de{x} = \iint_S (\nabla \times \bu) \, \bn \, \de{S}, 
          </me>
          where <m>S</m> is any surface with bounding curve <m>C_1 - C_2</m>, and with unit normal <m>\bn</m> positively oriented with the bounding curve. However, the right hand-side is zero by irrotationality, and therefore 
          <me>
            \int_{C_1} \bu \cdot \de{x} = \int_{C_2} \bu \cdot \de{x},
          </me>
          and our choice of curve in the definition of the potential is irrelevant. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The converse direction of the theorem follows directly from the fact that "curl grad equals zero", i.e. <m>\nabla \times \nabla \phi = 0</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </p>
    </theorem>
    
  </p>

  <p>
    Let us return to discussing the setting of potential flow.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to being irrotational, we furthermore have assumed that the flow is incompressible. Therefore from <xref ref="def-incompressible"/>,
    <men xml:id="eqn-2d-divu">
      \nabla \cdot \bu = \pd{u}{x} + \pd{v}{y} = \pd{^2\phi}{x^2} + \pd{^2\phi}{y^2} = 0.
    </men>
    This is the crucial result, which is that in potential flows, we need only solve the Laplace equation: 
    <men xml:id="eqn-2d-laplace">
      \nabla^2 \phi = 0,
    </men>
    within the flow region. This is effectively a single linear equation for the single unknown <m>\phi</m>. However, for different problems, the boundary conditions can render even this "simple" problem difficult. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Once the velocity potential <m>\phi</m> has been solved, the velocities in the flow can be recovered from the relationship <xref ref="eqn-vel-potential"/>. The pressure in the flow also follows from Bernoulli's equation. For the situation of a steady potential flow, following <xref ref="thm-bernoulli-potential"/>, it is 
  <men xml:id="eqn-2d-bernoulli">
    \frac{p}{\rho} + \frac{1}{2} |\nabla \phi|^2 + \chi = \textrm{constant}.
  </men>
  </p>


  <subsection>
    <title>Elementary flows</title>

    <p>The next three examples will introduce you to the elementary flows consisting of uniform flow, stagnation point flow, and line source/sink flows. You will also investigate the notion of a source "strength".</p>
    
  <p>
    <example xml:id="example-potential-uniform">
      <title>Uniform flow</title>
      <idx><h>uniform flow</h></idx>
     <p>
      Consider the potential given by the linear function 
      <me>
        \phi(x, y) = Ux \cos\alpha + Uy \sin\alpha,
      </me>
      with constants <m>U</m> and <m>\alpha</m>. Then by differentiation we have that the velicity is 
      <me>
        \bu = U[\cos\alpha, \sin\alpha].
      </me>
     </p> 

     <p>
      The image shown below shows the streamlines of the flow.

  <p>
    <example xml:id="example-potential-stagnation">
      <title>Stagnation point flow</title><idx><h>stagnation point flow</h></idx>
      <p>
        We can verify that the velocity potential 
        <me>
          \phi = \frac{1}{2} (x^2 - y^2),
        </me>
        satisfies Laplace's equation. The corresponding velocity field is given by 
        <me>
          [u, v] = [x, -y]. 
        </me>
       and corresponds to <em>stagnation point flow</em>.
      </p>

      <p> The streamlines (or velocity field) is shown below.
      <figure xml:id="fig-potential-stagnation">

      </p>
      
    </example>
  </p>

<p>
  <example xml:id="example-potential-linesource">
    <title>Line source</title>
   <idx><h>line source</h></idx> 

   <p>
   We aim to derive the potential and velocity for a <em>line source</em>, imagined as the flow consisting of a point source or point sink that ejects/drains fluid from a point in space. Since it would be expected for the potential to be axisymmetric, we attempt to solve <m>\nabla^2 \phi = 0</m> in plane polar coordinates. This is given by
   <me>
    \nabla^2 \phi = \frac{1}{r} \pd{}{r}\left(r \pd{\phi}{r}\right) + \frac{1}{r^2} \pd{^2 \phi}{\theta^2} = 0.
   </me>
   We assume that the potential takes the form <m>\phi = \phi(r)</m>. Then direct integration gives
   <me>
    \phi = \frac{Q}{2\pi} \log r, 
   </me>
   where we have set an additional constant of integration to zero without loss of generality. The leading constant has been set to <m>Q/(2\pi)</m> so that <m>Q</m> can be later identified with a physical quantity. 
  </p> 

  <p>
    The velocity then follows from consideration of the gradient in polar form, 
    <me>
      \bu = \nabla \phi = \pd{\phi}{r} \be_r + \frac{1}{r}\pd{\phi}{\theta} \be_{\theta} = \frac{Q}{2\pi r} \be_r,
    </me>
    where the unit vectors written in the Cartesian basis are <m>\be_r = [\cos\theta, \sin\theta]</m> and <m>\be_{\theta} = [-\sin\theta, \cos\theta]</m>. Thus we can write the velocity as 
    <me>
      \bu = \frac{Q}{2\pi r^2} r[\cos\theta, \sin\theta] = \frac{Q}{2\pi r^2} [x, y].
    </me>
   The above corresponds to a velocity field directed radially outwards from the origin. The flow is a called a <em>line source</em> because fluid is ejected from the origin (a source). It refers to a "line" because in <m>(x, y, z)</m>, the source runs parallel to the <m>z</m>-axis.  
  </p>


      <p> The streamlines (or velocity field) are shown below.
      <figure xml:id="fig-potential-linesource">
        <image source="linesource" width="90%"/> 
          <caption>Streamlines (or velocity field) of line source flow.</caption>
        </figure>
      </p>

  <p>
    Let us also identify the <em>strength</em> of this line source. Consider a closed contour <m>C</m> around the origin. Then the quantity 
    <me>
      \int_C \bu \cdot \bn \, \de{s},
    </me>
    is the flux (the flow per unit time) of fluid crossing the contour, with <m>\bn</m> denoting the unit normal along <m>C</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    For simplicity, let us take the contour <m>C</m> to be a circle of constant radius <m>r = a</m>. Then since the unit normal is precisely <m>\be_r</m>, we have that 
    <me>
      \int_C \bu \cdot \bn \, \de{s} = \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{Q}{2\pi a} \be_r \cdot \be_r \, (a \, \de\theta) = Q. 
    </me>
   In computing the above integral, remember that the conversion following the polar Jacobian is <m>\de{s} = r \de{\theta}</m> where <m>r = a</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Therefore, <m>Q</m> is the rate at which fluid is produced from the line source. If <m>Q \lt 0</m>, we refer to the flow as a <em>line sink</em>.
    <idx><h>line sink</h></idx>
  </p>
    
  </example>
</p>

<p>
  Crucially, because the governing fluid mechanical equation is only Laplace's equation: this is a linear partial differential equation, and therefore the summation of elementary flows also produces an admissible flow. 
</p>

<p>
  <example xml:id="example-potential-movingsource">
    <title>Line source in a uniform flow</title>
   <p> 
   For instance, we may combine a uniform flow in the <m>x</m>-direction with a line source:
  <me>
    \phi = Ux + \frac{Q}{2\pi} \log r = Ux + \frac{Q}{2\pi} \log \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
  </me>
  We can then obtain the velocity field as 
  <me>
    \bu = [U, 0] + \frac{Q}{2\pi(x^2 + y^2)} [x, y].
  </me>
</p>

  <section>
   <title>The streamfunction</title>

   <p>
    Our next task is to introduce the concept of the <em>streamfunction</em>. Remember that in 2D, the irrotational flow led to the equation <xref ref="eqn-2d-irrotational"/> and this led to the existence of the potential function. If we begin with incompressibility, however, we have <xref ref="eqn-2d-divu"/>, which can be written as 
    <men xml:id="eqn-1d-divu-cross">
      \nabla \times [-v, u] = 0.
    </men>
    And we can deduce the existence of an analogous function, the <em>streamfunction</em>, <m>\psi(x, y, t)</m> satisfying, 
    <men xml:id="eqn-2d-uv-streamfunction">
      u = \pd{\psi}{y} \quad \textrm{and} \quad v = -\pd{\psi}{x}.
    </men>
  Alternatively and more conveniently, we can write 
    <men xml:id="eqn-2d-streamfunction">
      \bu = \nabla \times (\psi \bk).
    </men>
    To establish the existence of the streamfunction, we follow a similar proof as in <xref ref="thm-exist-potential"/> but now with the definition that 
   <men xml:id="eqn-streamfunction-def-psi">
    \psi(x, y, t) = \psi_0(t) + \int_0^{\bx} (u \de{y} - v \de{x}),
   </men>
   where again <m>\psi_0(t)</m> is an arbitrary function of <m>t</m>. The proof is otherwise identical, relying on establishing the independence of path of the integral using Stokes' theorem.  
   </p>

   <p>
    Why all this work? The streamfunction has an intuitive intepretation via the following result. 

    <theorem xml:id="thm-streamfunction">
      <title>The streamfunction is constant along streamlines</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The streamfunction, <m>\psi(x, y, t)</m>, is constant along streamlines of the flow (i.e. the trajectory formed by a particle in the flow).
        </p>
      </statement>

      <p>
      <proof>
        <p>
          The proof follows simply by the fact that
          <me>
            \bu \cdot \nabla \psi = \left(\pd{\psi}{y}, -\pd{\psi}{x}\right) \cdot \left(\pd{\psi}{x}, \pd{\psi}{y}\right) = 0,
          </me>
          and for which the substitution in the first equality follows from <xref ref="eqn-2d-uv-streamfunction"/>. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The above equality indicates that the velocity vector, <m>\bu</m>, is orthogonal to the vector pointing along <m>\nabla \psi</m>. However, it is known from Vector Calculus that <m>\nabla \psi</m> runs along curves of steepest descent/ascent of <m>\psi</m>---these must hence be orthogonal to the level sets of <m>\psi</m>. Therefore, the level sets of <m>\psi</m> are tangential to <m>\bu</m> (the definition of a streamline).
        </p>
      </proof>
    </p>
    </theorem>
   </p>


   <p>
    A graphical depiction of the property in <xref ref="thm-streamfunction"/> is shown below.

    <figure xml:id="fig-streamfunction">
      <image source="streamfunction.jpg" width="70%"/>
      <caption>Flow between two streamlines, where the streamlines <m>\psi_1</m> and <m>\psi_2</m> are constant. Later, we will consider the flux through the contour <m>C</m> illustrated in the figure along with its unit normal <m>\bn</m>.</caption>
    </figure>


      <!-- <figure>
        <image source="uniformflow" width="90%"/>

        </figure> -->

   </p>


   <p>
    The streamfunction is thus constant on streamlines. Consider two streamlines. The following theorem relates the flux between the streamlines to the streamline values. 

    <theorem xml:id="thm-flux-streamlines">
      <title>Flux between streamlines</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
        Consider streamlines <m>\psi = \psi_1</m> and <m>\psi = \psi_2</m>. The <em>flux</em> (net flow of fluid) between the two streamlines is given by
        <me>
          \textrm{flux} = \psi_1 - \psi_2.
        </me>
        </p>
      </statement>

      <p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            By definition, the flux is given by the integral 
            <me>
              \int_C \bu \cdot \bn \, \de{s},
            </me>
            where <m>C</m> is any smooth path joining the two streamlines with unit normal <m>\bn</m>, as shown in FIGURE. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Note that given the curve, the unit normal is written as <m>[-\de{y}, \de{x}]/\de s</m>, so <m>\bn \de{s} = [\de{y}, -\de{x}]</m>. Then the flux is re-written as the following: 
            <md>
              <mrow>\textrm{flux} \amp= \int_C \left[\pd{\psi}{y}, -\pd{\psi}{x}\right] \cdot [\de{y}, \de{x}], </mrow>
              <mrow>\amp= \int_C \left(\pd{\psi}{x} \, \de{x} + \pd{\psi}{y} \right), </mrow>
              <mrow>\amp= \bigl[ \psi \bigr]_C, </mrow>
              <mrow>\amp= \psi_2 - \psi_1. </mrow>
            </md>
          In the third line above, <m>[\psi]_C</m> is the change of <m>\psi</m> across the contour.  
          Note that there is somewhat an arbitrary choice of direction for the contour <m>C</m>, as related to the selection of the normal direction <m>\bn</m>, and the positivity or negativity of the flux. 
        </p>
        </proof>
      </p>

    </theorem>
  </p>
      
    
    <p>
        Finally, note that the velocity potential was governed by Laplace's equation, <m>\nabla^2 \phi = 0</m>. The streamfunction is also governed by the same Laplace's equation. 

       
   <theorem xml:id="thm-streamfunction-laplace">
          <title>Streamfunction satisfies Laplace's equation</title>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Like the velocity potential, the streamfunction satisfies Laplace's equation: 
              <men xml:id="eqn-2d-streamfunction-laplace">
                \pd{^2 \psi}{x^2} + \pd{^2 \psi}{y^2} = \nabla^2 \psi = 0.
              </men>
            </p>
          </statement>

          <p>
            <proof>
              <p>
                Substitute the relationship <xref ref="eqn-2d-uv-streamfunction"/> into <xref ref="eqn-2d-irrotational"/>.
              </p>
            </proof>
          </p>
        </theorem>
   </p>

   <p>
    Like in the situation of certain flows, e.g. the line source in <xref ref="example-potential-linesource"/>, it is easier to work in alternative coordinate systems to study the streamfunction. Since we know that <m>\bu = \nabla \times (\psi \bk)</m> by <xref ref="eqn-2d-streamfunction"/>, we can use the conversion of the curl to polar coordinates in <xref ref="eqn-identity-curlpolar"/> to give 
    <men xml:id="eqn-streamfunction-polar">
      u_r = \frac{1}{r} \pd{\psi}{\theta} \quad \textrm{and} \quad u_{\theta} = -\pd{\psi}{r}\,
    </men>
   which allows us to relate the radial and angular velocities to the streamfunction. 
   </p>

   <subsection>
    <title>Elementary flows</title>

   <p>
    Let us return to each of the examples in <xref ref="sec-Potential-and-streamfunction"/> and reconsider their corresponding streamfunctions. 
   </p>


  <p>
    <example>
      <title>Uniform flow</title>
      <idx><h>uniform flow, streamfunction</h></idx>

      <p>
        From <xref ref="example-potential-uniform"/>, we can directly integrate <m>u = \psi_y</m> and <m>v = -\psi_x</m> to get 
        <me>
          \psi = Uy\cos\alpha - Ux\sin\alpha, 
        </me>
       up to an arbitrary constant. Therefore, lines of constant <m>\psi</m> correspond to 
       <me>
        y = x\tan\alpha + \textrm{constant},
       </me>
      which indeed yields the image seen in <xref ref="fig-potential-uniform"/>.
      </p>
    </example>
  </p>

  <p>
    <example>
      <title>Stagnation point flow</title><idx><h>stagnation point flow, streamfunction</h></idx>

      <p>
        Now turning to <xref ref="example-potential-stagnation"/>, we integrate <m>u = y = \psi_x</m> and <m>v = x = \psi_y</m>. This gives
        <me>
          \psi = xy, 
        </me>
        up to an arbitrary constant. Indeed curves of constant <m>\psi</m> match the hyperbole shown in <xref ref="fig-potential-stagnation"/>.

    For the situation of the line source in <xref ref="example-potential-linesource"/>, we want to work with polar coordinates. From the previous work, we have for this situation the potential <m>\phi = Q/(2\pi log r</m>. It then follows from the polar version of the gradient in <xref ref="eqn-identity-grad-polar"/>, that the velocity is entirely radial and 
    <men xml:id="eqn-streamfunction-u-linesource">
     \bu = \pd{\phi}{r}\be_r + 0 = \frac{Q}{2\pi r} \be_r.
    </men>
    We use the formulae in <xref ref="eqn-streamfunction-polar"/> and integrate <m>\frac{1}{r} \pd{\psi}{\theta} = \frac{Q}{2\pi r}</m> yielding
    <me>
      \psi = \frac{Q}{2\pi} \theta.
    </me>
    Then indeed note that the lines of constant <m>\psi</m> are given by the radial lines of constant <m>\theta</m>, matching the illustration in <xref ref="fig-potential-linesource"/>.  
   </p>
  </example>
</p>
   
<p>
    Another remark concerns the fact that <m>\psi</m> is a multi-valued function in the example of the line source <xref ref="example-streamfunction-linesource"/>, gaining a jump of <m>Q</m> every time the origin is encircled. This is indeed a warning that the standard proof, analogous to <xref ref="thm-exist-potential"/>, leading to the existence of a unique streamfunction, via <xref ref="eqn-streamfunction-def-psi"/> would not apply since the velocity field <xref ref="example-streamfunction-linesource"/> is not defined at the origin. However, despite this, we see that the streamfunction provides well-defined predictions of streamlines on the <em>cut</em> plane with e.g. <m>\theta \in [0, 2\pi)</m>.
   </p>

<p>
  <example>
    <title>Line source in a uniform flow</title>

  <p>
    Like the case of the potential function in <xref ref="example-potential-movingsource"/>, the linearity of the equation governing the streamfunction implies that we can consider the combination of those streamfunctions for a line source with a uniform flow. This yields 
    <me>
      \psi = Uy + \frac{Q}{2\pi}\theta, 
    </me>
    for the case of uniform flow of speed <m>U</m> in the positive <m>x</m>-direction. The streamlines are then given by 
    <me>
      Uy + \frac{Q}{2\pi} \theta = \frac{Q}{2\pi}C,
    </me>
   having designed the constant combination on the right hand-side for convenience. Then using <m>y = r\sin\theta</m>, we have
   <me>
    r = \left(\frac{Q}{2\pi U}\right) \frac{C - \theta}{\sin\theta}.
   </me>
  </p>
  </example>
</p>

<p>
  Our previous examples were reliant on considering the flows generated by the velocity potentials studied previously. However, we can also consider "fundamental solutions" of the equation <m>\nabla^2 \psi = 0</m> in their own right. Recall that in deriving the velocity potential of the line source in <xref ref="example-potential-linesource"/>, we considered the solution of an axi-symmetric problem, where <m>\phi = \phi(r)</m> is only dependent on the distance from the origin. A similar argument must imply that the analogous axi-symmetric streamfunction is a permissible solution. And this leads us to the following example. 
</p>

<p>
  <example xml:id="example-streamfunction-linevortex">
   <title>Line vortex </title>
   <idx><h>line vortex</h></idx>

   <p>
    The fundamental solution for the streamfunction, in plane polar coordinates, is the axisymmetric solution, 
    <men xml:id="eqn-streamfunction-linevortex">
      \psi = -\frac{\Gamma}{2\pi}\log r,
    </men>
    defined up to a constant, and corresponds to a <em>line vortex</em>.
   </p>

   <p>
    The streamlines of such a flow correspond to circular trajectories with <m>r</m> constant, and are visualised in 
    <!-- <xref ref="fig-streamfunction-linevortex"/>. -->

      <figure xml:id="fig-streamfunction-linevortex">
        <image source="linevortex" width="90%"/> 
          <caption>Streamlines (or velocity field) of a line vortex with <m>\Gamma = 1</m>.</caption>
        </figure>
  </p>


   <p>
    Recall that the radial and angular velocities are given by <xref ref="eqn-streamfunction-polar"/>. Therefore, we see that the velocity vector is given by 
    <me>
      \bu = -\pd{\psi}{r} \be_{\theta} = \frac{\Gamma}{2\pi r} \be_{\theta},
    </me>
    and thus this flow corresponds to entirely circular trajectories orbiting the origin, and with angular velocity increasing as <m>r \to 0</m>.
   </p>

   <p>
    The quantity <m>\Gamma</m> is called the <em>vortex strength</em>, analogous to the source strength <m>Q</m> in <xref ref="example-potential-linesource"/>. Let us consider the amount of circulation around a contour <m>C</m> that contains the origin: 
    <me>
      \oint_C \bu \cdot \de{\bx} = \oint_C (u \, \de{x} + v \, \de{y}),
    </me>
    i.e. one envisions encircling the origin along <m>C</m>, adding up each of the velocity components tangential to the path. This is the circulation. By Stokes' theorem it is equal to the flux of vorticity of the corresponding bounding surface. 
   </p>

   <p>
    Choosing <m>C</m> to be the circle of radius <m>r = a</m>, we have <m>\de{\bx} = a \be_{\theta} \de{\theta}</m>. Then the circulation is given by
    <me>
      \oint_C \bu \cdot \de{\bx} = \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\Gamma}{2\pi a} \be_{\theta} \cdot \be_{\theta} a \de\theta = \Gamma.
    </me>
    So indeed this gives us an intuitive understanding of <m>\Gamma</m>. Notice that <m>\Gamma \gt 0</m> corresponds to flow in the anticlockwise sense, and <m>\Gamma \lt 0</m> corresponds to flow in the clockwise sense.

  <title>The complex potential</title>

 <p>
  In the previous two sections, we studied the properties and utility of the velocity potential <m>\phi</m> and streamfunction <m>\psi</m> in the context of two-dimensional potential flows (inviscid, incompressible, irrotational). We did this with techniques from real-valued Vector Calculus.  As it turns out, there is a much more elegant and powerful framework for studying two-dimensional flow which leverages the significant power of complex analysis and complex variables. 
 </p>

 <p>
  In fact, you may have already noticed this on an intuitive level, given the intimate relationships between <m>\phi</m> and <m>\psi</m>, seeming to exhibit a certain kind of symmetry in formulae and operations. Complex analysis is the language in which we can make this kind of "symmetry" transparent. 
 </p>

 <p>
  We begin by reviewing (or in some cases, introducing) you to some key theorems about the properties of well-behaved (analytic) complex functions. 
 </p>

 <p>
  In his section, we will refer to a complex function generically as
  <me>f(z) = u(x, y) + \im v(x, y)
  </me>
  where <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> and the real-valued decompositions of the complex-valued function <m>f</m>. Also, <m>z = x + \im y</m>.
 </p>

 <p>
  A complex function is differentiated in much the same way as real-valued functions, with the definition that 
  <men xml:id="eqn-complex-derivative">
    f'(z) = \lim_{\Delta z \to 0} \frac{f(z + \Delta z) - f(z)}{\Delta z}.
  </men>
 The crucial difference with real-valued differentiation is that the above limit is required to hold whilst approaching the point <m>z</m> in any direction of the complex plane.
 </p>

 <p>
  <remark>
    <p>
      As long as you stay away from exceptional points of a function, the "calculus" of complex functions is largely the same as for real-valued functions, e.g. 
      <md>
       <mrow> \dd{(z^m)}{z} = mz^{m-1}, \qquad \dd{\e^z}{z} = \e^z,</mrow> 
      <mrow>\dd{(\log (z+1))}{z} = \frac{1}{z + 1}, \quad \dd{\sin(z^2)}{z} = 2z\cos(z^2). </mrow>
      </md>
      and the usual rules of algebraic manipulations hold. There are some caveats, however, which are dealt with on an individual manner.
    </p>
  </remark>
 </p>


 <p>
  Below, we will often use susbcripts for partial differentiation, e.g. <m>u_x = \pd{u}{x}</m>.
 </p>

 <subsection xml:id="subsec-complex-introduction">
  <title>Cauchy's theorem and harmonic functions</title>

  <p>We will follow the reference text by <xref ref="ref-kreyszig"/> and <xref ref="ref-fornberg"/>  and introduce the basic notions of complex functions that we will need. 
  </p>

  <p>
    <definition xml:id="def-analytic">
      <title>Analyticity</title>
      <idx><h>analytic</h></idx>
      <statement>
        <p>
        A function <m>f: \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}</m> is said to be analytic in a domain if <m>f(z)</m> is defined and differentiable at all points in the domain. The function is said to be <em>analytic at a point</em> <m>z = z_0</m> if it is analytic in a neighbourhood of <m>z_0</m>.     
        </p>

        <p>
          When we refer to an <em>analytic function</em>, we mean a function that is analytic in some domain of <m>\mathbb{C}</m> (often clear by context).
        </p>

        <p>
      The function is <em>holomorphic</em><idx><h>holomorphic</h></idx> if it is analytic; the terms are synonyms. 
        </p>

        <p>
          An analytic function is <em>entire</em><idx><h>entire</h></idx> if its region of analyticity includes all points in <m>\mathbb{C}</m>, including infinity. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that above, we have stated that a function is analytic if it is well-defined and differentiable <em>once</em>(!) As it turns out, the requirement that a complex-valued function is differentiable is a strong condition. An analytic function turns out to be infinitely differentiable by consequence!
  </p>
 
  <p>
  <remark>
    <p>
      In this module, we will not be concerned with formalities when they are not relevant. For example, in our definition of analyticity, we do not specify if the relevant domains are open or closed. The functions we work with are generally non-pathological---they may have isolated singularities or exceptional points, but generally the application and context will make it clear the limits of our results.
    </p>
  </remark>
 </p>

  <p>
    Now we have one of the most important theorems of complex analysis. 

    <theorem xml:id="thm-CR1">
      <title>Cauchy-Riemann equations I</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
         If <m>f(z) = u(x, y) + \im v(x, u)</m> is differentiable, then the Cauchy-Riemann equations, given by
       <men xml:id="eqn-CR">
       u_x = v_y \quad \text{and} \quad u_y = -v_x,
       </men>
       hold.
        </p>

        <p>
          In particular, if <m>f</m> is analytic on a domain, then its real and complex parts must satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations <xref ref="eqn-CR"/> (in that domain).
        </p>
      </statement>

      <p>
        <proof>
          <p>
            (Non-examinable)
          </p>
          <p> 
            This follows by considering the definition of the derivative <xref ref="eqn-complex-derivative"/> when the point <m>z</m> is approached from the <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> directions. 
          </p>

          <p>
            With <m>\Delta z = \Delta x</m> real, we can verify from applying the definition that 
            <me>
              f'(z) = \pd{u}{x} + \im \pd{v}{x}.
            </me>
            On the other hand, approaching with <m>\Delta z = \im \Delta y</m> gives 
            <me>
              f'(z) = -\im \pd{u}{y} + \pd{v}{y}. 
            </me>
          Equating the two results then yields the Cauchy-Riemann equations.
          </p>
        </proof>
      </p>
    </theorem>
  </p>

<p>
  It turns out that the Cauchy-Riemann equations are not only necessary to an analytic function, but are actually sufficient as well. 

  <theorem xml:id="thm-CR2">
    <title>Cauchy-Riemann equations II</title>

          The proof is not difficult, but we will refer students to <xref ref="ref-kreyszig"/> for its proof. It relies on constructing the derivative of <m>f</m> along any direction using the decomposition into the two Cartesian directions.

<p>
  Our last step involves relating complex functions to the solution of Laplace's equation(s), i.e. <xref ref="eqn-2d-laplace"/> or <xref ref="eqn-2d-streamfunction-laplace"/>, that govern potential flow.

  <theorem xml:id="thm-complex-laplace">
    <title>Analyticity and Laplace's equation</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
      If <m>f(z) = u(x, y) + \im v(x, y)</m> is analytic in a domain <m>D</m>, then <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> satisfy Laplace's equation, 
      <me>
        \nabla^2 u = u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0 \quad \textrm{and} \quad

      in <m>D</m>, and have continuous second partial derivatives in <m>D</m>.
          
      </p>
    </statement>

    <p>
      <proof>
        <p>
          Since <m>f</m> is analytic, then it follows from <xref ref="thm-CR1"/> that <m>u_x = v_y</m> and <m>u_y = -v_x</m>. It furthermore follows from <xref ref="thm-complex-inf-derivatives"/> that <m>f</m> is differentiable to all orders; therefore, we can take derivatives to obtain 
          <me>
            u_{xx} = v_{yx} \quad \text{and} \quad -u_{yy} = v_{xy}. 
          </me>
          The second derivatives are continuous and therefore <m>v_{xy} = v_{yx}</m>. Therefore <m>u_{xx} + u_{yy} = 0</m>. Laplace's equation is analogously proved for <m>v</m>.
          
        </p>
      </proof>
    </p>
  </theorem>
</p>

<p>
  The above theorem is truly a remarkable result; it would not be a stretch to state that this single result was at the forefront of why complex analysis played such an important role in the development of applied mathematics and physics in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. 
</p>

<p>
  Since Laplace's equation, <m>\nabla^2 \phi = 0</m>, is such an important equation in physics, occuring in theories of gravitation, electrostatics, fluid mechanics, etc. the theorem establishes that there exists a parallel theory in the language of complex variables for the specific case of two-dimensional applications. 
</p>

<p>
  A potential fluid, for example, can be studied by manipulating complex functions of the form 
  <me>
    f(z) = \phi(x, y) + \im \psi(x, y).
  </me>
  One can envision all kinds of different forms of <m>f</m>---polynomials, cosines and sines, exponentials, logarithms, etc. As long as the function is locally differentiable, it is thus analytic and therefore can be associated with (some kind of) fluid flow.

 <subsection xml:id="subsec-complex-examples">
  <title>Examples of elementary flows</title>

  <p>
    Let us return to the examples of flows studied in <xref ref="sec-Potential-and-streamfunction"/> and re-interpret them using the theory of analytic functions.
  </p>

  <p>
    We will associate the velocity potential, <m>\phi</m>, and streamfunction <m>\psi</m> with an analytic function in the following way. 

    <definition xml:id="def-complex-potential">
      <statement>
        <p>
         Let <m>\phi(x,y)</m> and <m>\psi(x, y)</m> be the respective velocity potential and streamfunction for some potential flow. We define
    <men xml:id="eqn-complex-potential">

      <p>
        The complex logarithm is an example of a function that is not analytic at the isolated point <m>z = 0</m> where it possesess a <em>branch point</em>. However, it still provides a permissible analytic function away from the origin. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The evaluation of the complex logarithm can be performed via the definition 
        <men xml:id="eqn-complex-logarithm">
          \log z = \log r + \im \theta,
        </men>
        where <m>z = r\e^{\im \theta}</m> is the polar form representation of <m>z</m>. In particular <m>log z</m> is a multi-function with a <em>branch point</em> at the origin. 
      </p>

      <p>
        With the above decomposition of the logarithm in mind, notice that we can then conclude that the velocity potential and streamfunction are given by 
        <me>
          \phi = \Re[f] = \frac{Q}{2\pi} \log r \quad \text{and} \quad
          \psi = \Im[f] = \frac{Q}{2\pi} \theta.
        </me>
        Indeed the streamlines are along the rays <m>\theta</m> constant.
      </p>

      <p>
        From <xref ref="eqn-complex-linesource"/>, we can also compute the velocities using the relationship <xref ref="eqn-complex-velocity"/>. We thus have 
        <me>
         u - \im v = \frac{Q}{2\pi} \frac{1}{z} = \frac{Q}{2\pi} \frac{x - \im y}{(x^2 + y^2)},
        </me>
        once we have multiplied the top and bottom by the conjugate of <m>z</m>.
      </p>
    </example>
  </p>

  <p>
    <example>
      <title>Line vortex flow</title>
      <idx><h>line vortex, complex</h></idx>

      <p>
        We can verify that the complex potential for a line vortex is given by
       <me>
        f(z) = -\frac{\im \Gamma}{2\pi} \log z.
       </me>
       This can be compared to  <xref ref="example-streamfunction-linevortex"/>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Again, using the definition of the complex logarithm, via <xref ref="eqn-complex-logarithm"/>, we can write <m>f</m> in terms of its real and complex components as 
        <me>
          f(z) = \frac{\Gamma}{2\pi} (\theta - \im \log r),
        </me>
        where <m>z = r\e^{\im\theta}</m>>.
       Therefore, the streamfunction is given by <m>\psi = -(\Gamma/2\pi) \log r</m> and is constant along circular trajectories with constant distance from the origin, <m>r</m>.
