  <title>Potential flows</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>Typically, the most basic introduction on fluid dynamics usually involves the study of two-dimensional incompressible and irrotational flows, otherwise known as <em>potential flows</em>. There is a good reason for this: the theory is elegant, visualisable, and uses to its benefit the enormous power of complex-variable theory. </p>

    <p>
      Previously, we defined the concept of vorticity via <m>\omega = \nabla \times \bu</m>, which serves as a measure of the local angular velocity of the flow. It turns out that in 2D, irrotational flows, with <m>\omega = 0</m>, provide a powerful restricton to the complexity of flows, allowing the development of the above <em>potential flow theory.</em>.

<section xml:id="sec-Potential-and-streamfunction">
  <title>The velocity potential</title>

<introduction>
  <p>
    In this chapter, we focus on 2D flows where the velocity vector is given by 
    <me>
      \bu(x, y, t) = u(x, y, t)\bi + v(x, y, z)\bj = [u, v].
    </me>
    With the velocity given as above, the vorticity is then 
    <men xml:id="eqn-2d-vorticity">
      \bomega = \nabla \times \bu = \left(\pd{v}{x} - \pd{u}{y}\right)\bk.
    </men>
    If we assume that the flow is irrotational according to <xref ref="def-irrotational"/>, then <m>\nabla \times \bu = 0</m> and 
    <men xml:id="eqn-2d-irrotational">
      \pd{v}{x} - \pd{u}{y} = 0.
    </men>
  </p>

  <p>
    Further, we know that if the flow is irrotational, then there exists a <em>velocity potential</em>, <m>\phi</m>, such that <m>\bu = \nabla \phi</m>. Thus the velocities are expressed as 
    <men xml:id="eqn-vel-potential">
      u = \pd{\phi}{x} \quad \textrm{and} \quad v = \pd{\phi}{y}.
    </men>
  </p>

  <p>
    The above result about irrotational flows is a standard result in Vector Calculus, but we will re-state the result here for reference, and provide a review of its proof. 
  </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-exist-potential">
      <title>Existence of a potential</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Consider a three-dimensional time-dependent velocity field, <m>\bu = \bu(\bx, t)</m> defined on a simply connected domain <m>\bx\in D \subset \mathbb{R}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^+.</m>
        </p>
          
          <p>Then <m>\bu</m> is irrotational, i.e. <m>\nabla \times \bu = 0</m> if and only if there exists a scalar potential, defined on <m>D \times \mathbb{R}^+</m>, such that <m>\bu = \nabla \phi</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <proof>
        <p>
          Define 
          <me>
            \phi(\bx, t) \equiv \phi_0(t) + \int_C \bu \cdot \de{x},
          </me>
          where <m>C</m> is any contour connecting an arbitrary origin point to the point <m>\bx</m> (changing the origin point will change the "constant" of integration <m>\phi_0(t)</m>).
        </p>

        <p>
          We can verify, using the definition of differentiation, and the fundamental theorme of calculus, applied along each of the three coordinate directions, that <m>\nabla \phi = \bu</m> as desired. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The key is to prove that the above definition is unique, regardless of the choice of contour <m>C</m>. To this end, consider two contours, <m>C_1</m> and <m>C_2</m>, both with the same origin point, <m>O</m>, and end point <m>P</m>. Then the contour <m>C_1 - C_2</m> is a close contour beginning and ending at <m>O</m>. 
        </p>

        <figure xml:id="fig-potential-proof">
          <caption>Proof of the uniqueness of the potential</caption>
          <image source="potentialproof.jpg" width="80%"/>
        </figure>

        <p>
          By Stokes' theorem, 
          <me>
            \int_{C_1 - C_2} \bu \cdot \de{x} = \iint_S (\nabla \times \bu) \, \bn \, \de{S}, 
          </me>
          where <m>S</m> is any surface with bounding curve <m>C_1 - C_2</m>, and with unit normal <m>\bn</m> positively oriented with the bounding curve. However, the right hand-side is zero by irrotationality, and therefore 
          <me>
            \int_{C_1} \bu \cdot \de{x} = \int_{C_2} \bu \cdot \de{x},
          </me>
          and our choice of curve in the definition of the potential is irrelevant. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The converse direction of the theorem follows directly from the fact that "curl grad equals zero", i.e. <m>\nabla \times \nabla \phi = 0</m>.
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>

  <p>
    Let us return to discussing the setting of potential flow.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to being irrotational, we furthermore have assumed that the flow is incompressible. Therefore from <xref ref="def-incompressible"/>,
    <men xml:id="eqn-2d-divu">
      \nabla \cdot \bu = \pd{u}{x} + \pd{v}{y} = \pd{^2\phi}{x^2} + \pd{^2\phi}{y^2} = 0.
    </men>
    This is the crucial result, which is that in potential flows, we need only solve the Laplace equation: 
    <men xml:id="eqn-2d-laplace">
      \nabla^2 \phi = 0,
    </men>
    within the flow region. This is effectively a single linear equation for the single unknown <m>\phi</m>. However, for different problems, the boundary conditions can render even this "simple" problem difficult. 
  </p>

  <p>
  Once the velocity potential <m>\phi</m> has been solved, the velocities in the flow can be recovered from the relationship <xref ref="eqn-vel-potential"/>. The pressure in the flow also follows from Bernoulli's equation. For the situation of a steady potential flow, following <xref ref="thm-bernoulli-potential"/>, it is 
  <men xml:id="eqn-2d-bernoulli">
    \frac{p}{\rho} + \frac{1}{2} |\nabla \phi|^2 + \chi = \textrm{constant}.
  </men>
  </p>
</introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>Elementary flows</title>

    <p>The next three examples will introduce you to the elementary flows consisting of uniform flow, stagnation point flow, and line source/sink flows. You will also investigate the notion of a source "strength".</p>
    
    <example xml:id="example-potential-uniform">
      <title>Uniform flow</title>
      <idx><h>uniform flow</h></idx>
     <p>
      Consider the potential given by the linear function 
      <me>
        \phi(x, y) = Ux \cos\alpha + Uy \sin\alpha,
      </me>
      with constants <m>U</m> and <m>\alpha</m>. Then by differentiation we have that the velicity is 
      <me>
        \bu = U[\cos\alpha, \sin\alpha].
      </me>
     </p> 

     <p>
      The image shown below shows the streamlines of the flow.
     </p>

      <figure xml:id="fig-potential-uniform">

        </figure>
    </example>
  
    <example xml:id="example-potential-stagnation">
      <title>Stagnation point flow</title><idx><h>stagnation point flow</h></idx>
      <p>
        We can verify that the velocity potential 
        <me>
          \phi = \frac{1}{2} (x^2 - y^2),
        </me>
        satisfies Laplace's equation. The corresponding velocity field is given by 
        <me>
          [u, v] = [x, -y]. 
        </me>
       and corresponds to <em>stagnation point flow</em>.
      </p>

      <p> The streamlines (or velocity field) is shown below.
      </p>
      <figure xml:id="fig-potential-stagnation">

    </example>
  
  <example xml:id="example-potential-linesource">
    <title>Line source</title>
   <idx><h>line source</h></idx> 

   <p>
   We aim to derive the potential and velocity for a <em>line source</em>, imagined as the flow consisting of a point source or point sink that ejects/drains fluid from a point in space. Since it would be expected for the potential to be axisymmetric, we attempt to solve <m>\nabla^2 \phi = 0</m> in plane polar coordinates. This is given by
   <me>
    \nabla^2 \phi = \frac{1}{r} \pd{}{r}\left(r \pd{\phi}{r}\right) + \frac{1}{r^2} \pd{^2 \phi}{\theta^2} = 0.
   </me>
   We assume that the potential takes the form <m>\phi = \phi(r)</m>. Then direct integration gives
   <me>
    \phi = \frac{Q}{2\pi} \log r, 
   </me>
   where we have set an additional constant of integration to zero without loss of generality. The leading constant has been set to <m>Q/(2\pi)</m> so that <m>Q</m> can be later identified with a physical quantity. 
  </p> 

  <p>
    The velocity then follows from consideration of the gradient in polar form, 
    <me>
      \bu = \nabla \phi = \pd{\phi}{r} \be_r + \frac{1}{r}\pd{\phi}{\theta} \be_{\theta} = \frac{Q}{2\pi r} \be_r,
    </me>
    where the unit vectors written in the Cartesian basis are <m>\be_r = [\cos\theta, \sin\theta]</m> and <m>\be_{\theta} = [-\sin\theta, \cos\theta]</m>. Thus we can write the velocity as 
    <me>
      \bu = \frac{Q}{2\pi r^2} r[\cos\theta, \sin\theta] = \frac{Q}{2\pi r^2} [x, y].
    </me>
   The above corresponds to a velocity field directed radially outwards from the origin. The flow is a called a <em>line source</em> because fluid is ejected from the origin (a source). It refers to a "line" because in <m>(x, y, z)</m>, the source runs parallel to the <m>z</m>-axis.  
  </p>


      <p> The streamlines (or velocity field) are shown below.
      </p>
      <figure xml:id="fig-potential-linesource">
          <caption>Streamlines (or velocity field) of line source flow.</caption>
        <image source="linesource" width="90%"/> 
        </figure>

  <p>
    Let us also identify the <em>strength</em> of this line source. Consider a closed contour <m>C</m> around the origin. Then the quantity 
    <me>
      \int_C \bu \cdot \bn \, \de{s},
    </me>
    is the flux (the flow per unit time) of fluid crossing the contour, with <m>\bn</m> denoting the unit normal along <m>C</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    For simplicity, let us take the contour <m>C</m> to be a circle of constant radius <m>r = a</m>. Then since the unit normal is precisely <m>\be_r</m>, we have that 
    <me>
      \int_C \bu \cdot \bn \, \de{s} = \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{Q}{2\pi a} \be_r \cdot \be_r \, (a \, \de\theta) = Q. 
    </me>
   In computing the above integral, remember that the conversion following the polar Jacobian is <m>\de{s} = r \de{\theta}</m> where <m>r = a</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Therefore, <m>Q</m> is the rate at which fluid is produced from the line source. If <m>Q \lt 0</m>, we refer to the flow as a <em>line sink</em>.
    <idx><h>line sink</h></idx>
  </p>
    
  </example>

<p>
  Crucially, because the governing fluid mechanical equation is only Laplace's equation: this is a linear partial differential equation, and therefore the summation of elementary flows also produces an admissible flow. 
</p>

  <example xml:id="example-potential-movingsource">
    <title>Line source in a uniform flow</title>
   <p> 
   For instance, we may combine a uniform flow in the <m>x</m>-direction with a line source:
  <me>
    \phi = Ux + \frac{Q}{2\pi} \log r = Ux + \frac{Q}{2\pi} \log \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
  </me>
  We can then obtain the velocity field as 
  <me>
    \bu = [U, 0] + \frac{Q}{2\pi(x^2 + y^2)} [x, y].
  </me>
</p> 

<p> The streamlines (or velocity field) is shown below.

   <title>The streamfunction</title>
<introduction>
   <p>
    Our next task is to introduce the concept of the <em>streamfunction</em>. Remember that in 2D, the irrotational flow led to the equation <xref ref="eqn-2d-irrotational"/> and this led to the existence of the potential function. If we begin with incompressibility, however, we have <xref ref="eqn-2d-divu"/>, which can be written as 
    <men xml:id="eqn-1d-divu-cross">
      \nabla \times [-v, u] = 0.
    </men>
    And we can deduce the existence of an analogous function, the <em>streamfunction</em>, <m>\psi(x, y, t)</m> satisfying, 
    <men xml:id="eqn-2d-uv-streamfunction">
      u = \pd{\psi}{y} \quad \textrm{and} \quad v = -\pd{\psi}{x}.
    </men>
  Alternatively and more conveniently, we can write 
    <men xml:id="eqn-2d-streamfunction">
      \bu = \nabla \times (\psi \bk).
    </men>
    To establish the existence of the streamfunction, we follow a similar proof as in <xref ref="thm-exist-potential"/> but now with the definition that 
   <men xml:id="eqn-streamfunction-def-psi">
    \psi(x, y, t) = \psi_0(t) + \int_0^{\bx} (u \de{y} - v \de{x}),
   </men>
   where again <m>\psi_0(t)</m> is an arbitrary function of <m>t</m>. The proof is otherwise identical, relying on establishing the independence of path of the integral using Stokes' theorem.  
   </p>

   <p>
    Why all this work? The streamfunction has an intuitive intepretation via the following result. </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-streamfunction">
      <title>The streamfunction is constant along streamlines</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          The streamfunction, <m>\psi(x, y, t)</m>, is constant along streamlines of the flow (i.e. the trajectory formed by a particle in the flow).
        </p>
      </statement>

      <proof>
        <p>
          The proof follows simply by the fact that
          <me>
            \bu \cdot \nabla \psi = \left(\pd{\psi}{y}, -\pd{\psi}{x}\right) \cdot \left(\pd{\psi}{x}, \pd{\psi}{y}\right) = 0,
          </me>
          and for which the substitution in the first equality follows from <xref ref="eqn-2d-uv-streamfunction"/>. 
        </p>

        <p>
          The above equality indicates that the velocity vector, <m>\bu</m>, is orthogonal to the vector pointing along <m>\nabla \psi</m>. However, it is known from Vector Calculus that <m>\nabla \psi</m> runs along curves of steepest descent/ascent of <m>\psi</m>---these must hence be orthogonal to the level sets of <m>\psi</m>. Therefore, the level sets of <m>\psi</m> are tangential to <m>\bu</m> (the definition of a streamline).
        </p>
      </proof>
    </theorem>


   <p>
    A graphical depiction of the property in <xref ref="thm-streamfunction"/> is shown below.</p>

    <figure xml:id="fig-streamfunction">
      <caption>Flow between two streamlines, where the streamlines <m>\psi_1</m> and <m>\psi_2</m> are constant. Later, we will consider the flux through the contour <m>C</m> illustrated in the figure along with its unit normal <m>\bn</m>.</caption>

        </figure> -->

   

   <p>
    The streamfunction is thus constant on streamlines. Consider two streamlines. The following theorem relates the flux between the streamlines to the streamline values. 
   </p>
    <theorem xml:id="thm-flux-streamlines">
      <title>Flux between streamlines</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
        Consider two streamlines <m>\psi = \psi_1</m> and <m>\psi = \psi_2</m>. We assume that the streamlines pass through the points A and B respectively. Consider a contour <m>C</m> connecting A and B. The <em>flux</em> (net flow of fluid) through <m>C</m> and hence between the streamlines is
        <me>
          |\textrm{flux}| = |\psi_2 - \psi_1|
        </me>
        We have not specified the sign of the flux as it is subject to the considered direction through <m>C</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>

        <proof>
          <p>
            By definition, the flux is given by the integral 
            <me>
              \int_C \bu \cdot \bn \, \de{s},
            </me>
            where <m>C</m> is any smooth path joining the two streamlines with unit normal <m>\bn</m>, as shown in <xref ref="fig-streamfunction"/>.
          </p>

          <p>
            Note that given the curve, and in consideration of a small arclength element <m>\de{s}</m>, the tangent and normal are given by 
            <me>
              \bt = \frac{[\de{x}, \de{y}]}{\sqrt{\de{x}^2 + \de{y}^2}} = \frac{[\de{x}, \de{y}]}{\de{s}}, \qquad 
              \bn = \frac{[-\de{y}, \de{x}]}{\de{s}}.
            </me>
            Therefore we can write <m>\bn \de{s} = [\de{y}, -\de{x}]</m>. Then the flux is re-written as the following: 
            <md>
              <mrow>\textrm{flux} \amp= \int_C \left[\pd{\psi}{y}, -\pd{\psi}{x}\right] \cdot [\de{y}, \de{x}], </mrow>
              <mrow>\amp= \int_C \left(\pd{\psi}{x} \, \de{x} + \pd{\psi}{y} \right), </mrow>
              <mrow>\amp= \bigl[ \psi \bigr]_C, </mrow>
              <mrow>\amp= \psi(B) - \psi(A), </mrow>
              <mrow>\amp= \psi_2 - \psi_1, </mrow>
            </md>
          In the third line above, <m>[\psi]_C</m> is the change of <m>\psi</m> across the contour.  
          Note that there is somewhat an arbitrary choice of direction for the contour <m>C</m>, as related to the selection of the normal direction <m>\bn</m>, and the positivity or negativity of the flux. To be safe, we have taken the absolute value in the problem.
        </p>
        </proof>

    </theorem>

    <p>
      An example of the use of the above theorem is given in <xref ref="ps-potential-fluxcalc"/>. 
    </p>

    <example>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let the velocity of a two-dimensional flow be given by the formula
          <me>
            \bu = [3ax^2 - 3ay^2, \, -6axy]
          </me>
          where <m>a</m> is a positive constant. By finding the streamfunction, <m>\psi</m>, calculate the volume flux across a curve connecting points <m>A = (0, 0)</m> and <m>B = (1, 1)</m> using <xref ref="thm-flux-streamlines"/>.
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          (Done in problem class)

          We can check, using the integration of velocity components that 
          <me>
            \psi = 3ax^2 y - a y^3 + C.
          </me>
          Hence the flux is
          <me>
            Q = \psi(B) - \psi(A) = 2a.
          </me>
          We can verify this flux should be positive if the normal is oriented to the right of the curve from A to B. 
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
      
    
    <p>
        Finally, note that the velocity potential was governed by Laplace's equation, <m>\nabla^2 \phi = 0</m>. The streamfunction is also governed by the same Laplace's equation. 
    </p>
       
   <theorem xml:id="thm-streamfunction-laplace">
          <title>Streamfunction satisfies Laplace's equation</title>
          <statement>
            <p>
              Like the velocity potential, the streamfunction satisfies Laplace's equation: 
              <men xml:id="eqn-2d-streamfunction-laplace">
                \pd{^2 \psi}{x^2} + \pd{^2 \psi}{y^2} = \nabla^2 \psi = 0.

            </p>
          </statement>

            <proof>

        </theorem>
   
   <p>
    Like in the situation of certain flows, e.g. the line source in <xref ref="example-potential-linesource"/>, it is easier to work in alternative coordinate systems to study the streamfunction. Since we know that <m>\bu = \nabla \times (\psi \bk)</m> by <xref ref="eqn-2d-streamfunction"/>, we can use the conversion of the curl to polar coordinates in <xref ref="eqn-identity-curlpolar"/> to give 
    <men xml:id="eqn-streamfunction-polar">
      u_r = \frac{1}{r} \pd{\psi}{\theta} \quad \textrm{and} \quad u_{\theta} = -\pd{\psi}{r}\,
    </men>
   which allows us to relate the radial and angular velocities to the streamfunction.

   <subsection>
    <title>Elementary flows</title>

   <p>
    Let us return to each of the examples in <xref ref="sec-Potential-and-streamfunction"/> and reconsider their corresponding streamfunctions. 
   </p>


    <example>
      <title>Uniform flow</title>
      <idx><h>uniform flow, streamfunction</h></idx>

      <p>
        From <xref ref="example-potential-uniform"/>, we can directly integrate <m>u = \psi_y</m> and <m>v = -\psi_x</m> to get 
        <me>
          \psi = Uy\cos\alpha - Ux\sin\alpha, 
        </me>
       up to an arbitrary constant. Therefore, lines of constant <m>\psi</m> correspond to 
       <me>
        y = x\tan\alpha + \textrm{constant},
       </me>
      which indeed yields the image seen in <xref ref="fig-potential-uniform"/>.
      </p>
    </example>

    <example>
      <title>Stagnation point flow</title><idx><h>stagnation point flow, streamfunction</h></idx>

      <p>
        Now turning to <xref ref="example-potential-stagnation"/>, we integrate <m>u = y = \psi_x</m> and <m>v = x = \psi_y</m>. This gives
        <me>
          \psi = xy, 
        </me>
        up to an arbitrary constant. Indeed curves of constant <m>\psi</m> match the hyperbole shown in <xref ref="fig-potential-stagnation"/>.
        
      </p>
    </example>

  <example xml:id="example-streamfunction-linesource">
    <title>Line source</title>
   <idx><h>line source, streamfunction</h></idx> 

   <p>
    For the situation of the line source in <xref ref="example-potential-linesource"/>, we want to work with polar coordinates. From the previous work, we have for this situation the potential <m>\phi = Q/(2\pi log r</m>. It then follows from the polar version of the gradient in <xref ref="eqn-identity-grad-polar"/>, that the velocity is entirely radial and 
    <men xml:id="eqn-streamfunction-u-linesource">
     \bu = \pd{\phi}{r}\be_r + 0 = \frac{Q}{2\pi r} \be_r.
    </men>
    We use the formulae in <xref ref="eqn-streamfunction-polar"/> and integrate <m>\frac{1}{r} \pd{\psi}{\theta} = \frac{Q}{2\pi r}</m> yielding
    <me>
      \psi = \frac{Q}{2\pi} \theta.
    </me>
    Then indeed note that the lines of constant <m>\psi</m> are given by the radial lines of constant <m>\theta</m>, matching the illustration in <xref ref="fig-potential-linesource"/>.  
   </p>
  </example>
   
<p>
    Another remark concerns the fact that <m>\psi</m> is a multi-valued function in the example of the line source <xref ref="example-streamfunction-linesource"/>, gaining a jump of <m>Q</m> every time the origin is encircled. This is indeed a warning that the standard proof, analogous to <xref ref="thm-exist-potential"/>, leading to the existence of a unique streamfunction, via <xref ref="eqn-streamfunction-def-psi"/> would not apply since the velocity field <xref ref="example-streamfunction-linesource"/> is not defined at the origin. However, despite this, we see that the streamfunction provides well-defined predictions of streamlines on the <em>cut</em> plane with e.g. <m>\theta \in [0, 2\pi)</m>.
   </p>

  <example>
    <title>Line source in a uniform flow</title>

  <p>
    Like the case of the potential function in <xref ref="example-potential-movingsource"/>, the linearity of the equation governing the streamfunction implies that we can consider the combination of those streamfunctions for a line source with a uniform flow. This yields 
    <me>
      \psi = Uy + \frac{Q}{2\pi}\theta, 
    </me>
    for the case of uniform flow of speed <m>U</m> in the positive <m>x</m>-direction. The streamlines are then given by 
    <me>
      Uy + \frac{Q}{2\pi} \theta = \frac{Q}{2\pi}C,
    </me>
   having designed the constant combination on the right hand-side for convenience. Then using <m>y = r\sin\theta</m>, we have
   <me>
    r = \left(\frac{Q}{2\pi U}\right) \frac{C - \theta}{\sin\theta}.
   </me>
  </p>
  </example>

<p>
  Our previous examples were reliant on considering the flows generated by the velocity potentials studied previously. However, we can also consider "fundamental solutions" of the equation <m>\nabla^2 \psi = 0</m> in their own right. Recall that in deriving the velocity potential of the line source in <xref ref="example-potential-linesource"/>, we considered the solution of an axi-symmetric problem, where <m>\phi = \phi(r)</m> is only dependent on the distance from the origin. A similar argument must imply that the analogous axi-symmetric streamfunction is a permissible solution. And this leads us to the following example. 
</p>

  <example xml:id="example-streamfunction-linevortex">
   <title>Line vortex </title>
   <idx><h>line vortex</h></idx>

   <p>
    The fundamental solution for the streamfunction, in plane polar coordinates, is the axisymmetric solution, 
    <men xml:id="eqn-streamfunction-linevortex">
      \psi = -\frac{\Gamma}{2\pi}\log r,
    </men>
    defined up to a constant, and corresponds to a <em>line vortex</em>.
   </p>

   <p>
    The streamlines of such a flow correspond to circular trajectories with <m>r</m> constant, and are visualised in 
    <!-- <xref ref="fig-streamfunction-linevortex"/>. -->
</p>

      <figure xml:id="fig-streamfunction-linevortex">
          <caption>Streamlines (or velocity field) of a line vortex with <m>\Gamma = 1</m>.</caption>
        <image source="linevortex" width="90%"/> 
        </figure>
  

   <p>
    Recall that the radial and angular velocities are given by <xref ref="eqn-streamfunction-polar"/>. Therefore, we see that the velocity vector is given by 
    <me>
      \bu = -\pd{\psi}{r} \be_{\theta} = \frac{\Gamma}{2\pi r} \be_{\theta},
    </me>
    and thus this flow corresponds to entirely circular trajectories orbiting the origin, and with angular velocity increasing as <m>r \to 0</m>.
   </p>

   <p>
    The quantity <m>\Gamma</m> is called the <em>vortex strength</em>, analogous to the source strength <m>Q</m> in <xref ref="example-potential-linesource"/>. Let us consider the amount of circulation around a contour <m>C</m> that contains the origin: 
    <me>
      \oint_C \bu \cdot \de{\bx} = \oint_C (u \, \de{x} + v \, \de{y}),
    </me>
    i.e. one envisions encircling the origin along <m>C</m>, adding up each of the velocity components tangential to the path. This is the circulation. By Stokes' theorem it is equal to the flux of vorticity of the corresponding bounding surface. 
   </p>

   <p>
    Choosing <m>C</m> to be the circle of radius <m>r = a</m>, we have <m>\de{\bx} = a \be_{\theta} \de{\theta}</m>. Then the circulation is given by
    <me>
      \oint_C \bu \cdot \de{\bx} = \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\Gamma}{2\pi a} \be_{\theta} \cdot \be_{\theta} a \de\theta = \Gamma.
    </me>
    So indeed this gives us an intuitive understanding of <m>\Gamma</m>. Notice that <m>\Gamma \gt 0</m> corresponds to flow in the anticlockwise sense, and <m>\Gamma \lt 0</m> corresponds to flow in the clockwise sense.
   </p>

   <p>
    In <xref ref="ps-streamfunction-flux-compute"/>, you will practice the computation of fluxes using line integrals.

<section xml:id="sec-complex-potential">
  <title>The complex potential</title>
<introduction>
 <p>
  In the previous two sections, we studied the properties and utility of the velocity potential <m>\phi</m> and streamfunction <m>\psi</m> in the context of two-dimensional potential flows (inviscid, incompressible, irrotational). We did this with techniques from real-valued Vector Calculus.  As it turns out, there is a much more elegant and powerful framework for studying two-dimensional flow which leverages the significant power of complex analysis and complex variables. 
 </p>

 <p>
  In fact, you may have already noticed this on an intuitive level, given the intimate relationships between <m>\phi</m> and <m>\psi</m>, seeming to exhibit a certain kind of symmetry in formulae and operations. Complex analysis is the language in which we can make this kind of "symmetry" transparent. 
 </p>

 <p>
  We begin by reviewing (or in some cases, introducing) you to some key theorems about the properties of well-behaved (analytic) complex functions. 
 </p>

 <p>
  In his section, we will refer to a complex function generically as
  <me>f(z) = u(x, y) + \im v(x, y)
  </me>
  where <m>u</m> and <m>v</m> and the real-valued decompositions of the complex-valued function <m>f</m>. Also, <m>z = x + \im y</m>.
 </p>

 <p>
  A complex function is differentiated in much the same way as real-valued functions, with the definition that 
  <men xml:id="eqn-complex-derivative">
    f'(z) = \lim_{\Delta z \to 0} \frac{f(z + \Delta z) - f(z)}{\Delta z}.
  </men>
 The crucial difference with real-valued differentiation is that the above limit is required to hold whilst approaching the point <m>z</m> in any direction of the complex plane.
 </p>

  <remark>
    <p>
      As long as you stay away from exceptional points of a function, the "calculus" of complex functions is largely the same as for real-valued functions, e.g. 
      <md>
       <mrow> \dd{(z^m)}{z} = mz^{m-1}, \qquad \dd{\e^z}{z} = \e^z,</mrow> 
      <mrow>\dd{(\log (z+1))}{z} = \frac{1}{z + 1}, \quad \dd{\sin(z^2)}{z} = 2z\cos(z^2). </mrow>
      </md>
      and the usual rules of algebraic manipulations hold. There are some caveats, however, which are dealt with on an individual manner.
    </p>

    <title>Examinable content</title>
   
    <p>
      The proofs of all theorems from this section are non-examinable, but you are expected to understand the theorems and their relevance to the theory of potential flow.

      <statement>
        <p>
        A function <m>f: \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}</m> is said to be analytic in a domain if <m>f(z)</m> is defined and differentiable at all points in the domain. The function is said to be <em>analytic at a point</em> <m>z = z_0</m> if it is analytic in a neighbourhood of <m>z_0</m>.     
        </p>

        <p>
          When we refer to an <em>analytic function</em>, we mean a function that is analytic in some domain of <m>\mathbb{C}</m> (often clear by context).
        </p>

        <p>
      The function is <em>holomorphic</em><idx><h>holomorphic</h></idx> if it is analytic; the terms are synonyms. 
        </p>

        <p>
          An analytic function is <em>entire</em><idx><h>entire</h></idx> if its region of analyticity includes all points in <m>\mathbb{C}</m>, including infinity. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

  <p>
    Note that above, we have stated that a function is analytic if it is well-defined and differentiable <em>once</em>(!) As it turns out, the requirement that a complex-valued function is differentiable is a strong condition. An analytic function turns out to be infinitely differentiable by consequence!
  </p>
 
  <remark>
    <p>
      In this module, we will not be concerned with formalities when they are not relevant. For example, in our definition of analyticity, we do not specify if the relevant domains are open or closed. The functions we work with are generally non-pathological---they may have isolated singularities or exceptional points, but generally the application and context will make it clear the limits of our results.

  <p>
    Now we have one of the most important theorems of complex analysis. </p>

    <theorem xml:id="thm-CR1">

        <p>
          In particular, if <m>f</m> is analytic on a domain, then its real and complex parts must satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations <xref ref="eqn-CR"/> (in that domain).

            This follows by considering the definition of the derivative <xref ref="eqn-complex-derivative"/> when the point <m>z</m> is approached from the <m>x</m> or <m>y</m> directions. 
          </p>

            On the other hand, approaching with <m>\Delta z = \im \Delta y</m> gives

              f'(z) = -\im \pd{u}{y} + \pd{v}{y}.

          Equating the two results then yields the Cauchy-Riemann equations.

  Our last step involves relating complex functions to the solution of Laplace's equation(s), i.e. <xref ref="eqn-2d-laplace"/> or <xref ref="eqn-2d-streamfunction-laplace"/>, that govern potential flow.

<p>
  The above theorem is truly a remarkable result; it would not be a stretch to state that this single result was at the forefront of why complex analysis played such an important role in the development of applied mathematics and physics in the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries. 
</p>

<p>
  Since Laplace's equation, <m>\nabla^2 \phi = 0</m>, is such an important equation in physics, occuring in theories of gravitation, electrostatics, fluid mechanics, etc. the theorem establishes that there exists a parallel theory in the language of complex variables for the specific case of two-dimensional applications. 
</p>

<p>
  A potential fluid, for example, can be studied by manipulating complex functions of the form 
  <me>
    f(z) = \phi(x, y) + \im \psi(x, y).
  </me>
  One can envision all kinds of different forms of <m>f</m>---polynomials, cosines and sines, exponentials, logarithms, etc. As long as the function is locally differentiable, it is thus analytic and therefore can be associated with (some kind of) fluid flow.

        The complex logarithm is an example of a function that is not analytic at the isolated point <m>z = 0</m> where it possesess a <em>branch point</em>. However, it still provides a permissible analytic function away from the origin. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The evaluation of the complex logarithm can be performed via the definition 
        <men xml:id="eqn-complex-logarithm">
          \log z = \log r + \im \theta,

      </p>

      <p>
        With the above decomposition of the logarithm in mind, notice that we can then conclude that the velocity potential and streamfunction are given by

         u - \im v = \frac{Q}{2\pi} \frac{1}{z} = \frac{Q}{2\pi} \frac{x - \im y}{(x^2 + y^2)},
        </me>
        once we have multiplied the top and bottom by the conjugate of <m>z</m>.

    </example>
  
    <example>
      <title>Line vortex flow</title>
      <idx><h>line vortex, complex</h></idx>

      <p>
        We can verify that the complex potential for a line vortex is given by
       <me>
        f(z) = -\frac{\im \Gamma}{2\pi} \log z.
       </me>
       This can be compared to  <xref ref="example-streamfunction-linevortex"/>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Again, using the definition of the complex logarithm, via <xref ref="eqn-complex-logarithm"/>, we can write <m>f</m> in terms of its real and complex components as 
        <me>
          f(z) = \frac{\Gamma}{2\pi} (\theta - \im \log r),
        </me>
        where <m>z = r\e^{\im\theta}</m>.</p>
        <p>
       Therefore, the streamfunction is given by <m>\psi = -(\Gamma/2\pi) \log r</m> and is constant along circular trajectories with constant distance from the origin, <m>r</m>.

  <title>The method of images</title>

  <introduction>
  <p>
    The preceeding sections would give the misleading impression that solving potential-flow problems for two-dimensional flows is easy. This is not the case, and the primary reason is due to the presence of <em>boundary conditions</em>. The elementary flows we have previously considered were unconfined and/or we did not consider additonal constraints on their behaviours at infinity. In reality, a real physical fluid, whether in the ocean, the air, or in a container, is confined in some direction, and we must often consider subtle questions about the mechanism that produces the fluid motion. 
  </p>

  <p>
    In this section, we consider the situation of solving for the potential flow in a fluid region with boundaries. Recall that this is equivalent to finding a velocity potential satisfying <m>\nabla^2 \phi = 0</m> or an analytic complex potential, <m>f(z)</m>. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Recall from <xref ref="note-noflux-BC"/> that on solid boundaries, we must impose the no-flux condition that
    <me>
      \bu \cdot \bn = \nabla \phi \cdot \bn = 0 \quad \text{on $\partial V$}.
    </me>
  </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection xml:id="subsec-images-planar">
    <title>Planar boundaries: a half-plane</title>

   <p>
    Consider the situation illustrated in <xref ref="image-planar01"/>.
</p> 
    <figure xml:id="image-planar01">
      <caption>A flow region in the right half-plane, with a single source placed at <m>x = d</m>.</caption>
      <image source="image-planar01.jpg" width="80%"/>
    </figure>
   
   <p>
    We envision a semi-infinite region of fluid bounded on the left by a wall at <m>x = 0</m>. A single (line) source of strength <m>Q</m> is placed at <m>x = d</m>. Therefore from <xref ref="eqn-complex-linesource"/>, we would expect that at least near <m>x = d</m>, the complex potential behaves as 
    <me>
      f(z) \sim \frac{Q}{2\pi} \log (z-d) \quad \text{as $z \to d$}.
    </me>
    However the above solution does not satisfy the required boundary conditions at <m>x = 0</m> since it corresponds to a velocity field for which the horizontal velocity penetrates through <m>x = 0</m>. This can be verified via inspection. For example, we can inspect the velocity or the streamlines; this is part of <xref ref="ps-image-planar01"/>.
   </p>

   <p>
    Rephrased in terms of the streamlines, the boundary condition at <m>x = 0</m> is equivalent to the constraint that 
    <me>
      \Im f(z) = \psi = \textrm{constant at $x = 0$}.
    </me>
   </p>

   <p>
    Our inspired solution to the above problem is referred to as <em>the method of images</em>.</p>

    <note xml:id="note-method-of-images">
      <title>Method of images</title>

      <p>
        Given potential flow problem, we consider the superposition of elementary sinks/sources, i.e. 
       <me>
        f(z) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} Q_j \log(z - z_j), 
       </me>
      and/or vortices,
      <me>
        f(z) = -\frac{\im}{2\pi} \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \Gamma_j \log(z - z_j).
      </me>
      The strengths and locations of the individual contributions are chosen so that boundary conditions on the required boundaries (including at infinity) can be met. 
      </p>
    </note>
   
   <p>
    Notice that the <em>linearity</em> of the potential flow problem is crucial: any analytic function is associated with a velocity potential that satisfies Laplace's equation, <m>\nabla^2 \phi = 0</m>, and therefore the superposition of such functions also yields a permissible complex potential, <m>f</m>. 
   </p>
    
    
    <p>We consider the addition of a "fictitious" image source, with the same strength at the reflected point <m>x = -d</m>, which lies outside of the posited fluid region. This gives the complex potential of 
    <me>
      f(z) = \frac{Q}{2\pi} \log(z - d) + \frac{Q}{2\pi} \log(z + d). 
    </me>
    This yields the illustration of the flow in <xref ref="fig-image-planar02"/>
</p> 
     <figure xml:id="fig-image-planar02">
      <caption>Placement of the image source at <m>x = -d</m> makes it so the boundary condition on <m>x = 0</m> can be satisfied.</caption>
      <image source="image-planar02.jpg" width="80%"/>
    </figure>
   
   <p>
    The corresponding complex velocity is given by 
    <me>
      u - \im v = f'(z) = \frac{Q}{2\pi}\frac{z}{z^2 - d^2}.
    </me>
    So indeed, on the central boundary, we have <m>z = \im y</m>, and 
    <me>
      u - \im v = - \im \frac{Q}{\pi} \frac{y}{y^2 + d^2},
    </me>
    and the velocity is entirely vertical. So indeed, the condition that <m>\bu \cdot \bn = 0</m> on the planar boundary is satisfied. 
   </p>

   <p>
    In order to study the complex velocity, <m>f(z)</m>, and develop an equation for the streamlines of the flow, we must first navigate the fact that the complex logarithm function is only well-defined in a slit complex plane. First, let
    <me>
    z - d = r_1 \e^{\im \theta_1} \quad \textrm{and} \quad z + d = r_2 \e^{\im \theta_2}.
    </me>
    Using the definition of the complex logarithm <xref ref="eqn-complex-logarithm"/>, we have
    <me>
    f(z) = \frac{Q}{2\pi} \left[ \log r_1 + \log r_2\right] + \im \frac{Q}{2\pi}\left[ \theta_1 + \theta_2 \right].
    </me>
    The definitions of <m>r_1, r_2</m> and <m>\theta_1, \theta_2</m>, are shown in the below figure. In order for each logarithm to be well defined, the angles <m>\theta_1</m> and <m>\theta_2</m> must be restricted to be less than a complete revolution. We thus restrict <m>\theta_1 \in [0, 2\pi)</m> and <m>\theta_1 \in [-\pi, \pi)</m>. 
  </p>
    <figure xml:id="fig-image-duallog">
      <caption>When considering the evaluation of the flow, we must take care of the fact that the logarithm is multi-valued. A branch cut from each of the two branch points is imposed.</caption>
      <image source="image-duallog.jpg" width="100%"/>
    </figure>
  <p>
  In <xref ref="ps-image-planar02"/>, you will be asked to develop an equation for the streamlines of this flow. 
   </p>

  <p>
    The above ideas can be extended to the situation of a line vortex in a half plane. Again, we are interested in describing the flow due to a line vortex at <m>z = d</m>, and therefore we expect that near this point,
    <me>
      f(z) \sim -\frac{\im\Gamma}{2\pi} \log(z - d) \quad \textrm{as $z \to d$}.
    </me>
    However, the above potential does not satisfy the necessary zero-flux condition at <m>x = 0</m>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this case, the approach is to add an image vortex at <m>z = -d</m>, but opposite in direction:
    <me>
      f(z) = -\frac{\im\Gamma}{2\pi} \log(z - d) + \frac{\im\Gamma}{2\pi} \log(z + d).
    </me>
    Therefore, this flow is composed by a line vortex circulating anticlockwise on the right, and a line vortex circulating clockwise on the left. It can be verified that the complex velocity is given by 
    <me>
      u - \im v = -\frac{\im \Gamma d}{\pi(z^2 - d^2)}
    </me>
    and indeed the velocity at <m>x = 0</m> is entirely vertical and there is no flux through the boundary. 
  </p>

  <p>
    There is an exercise in <xref ref="ps-image-planar03"/>.
  </p>

  <remark>
    <title>Uniqueness of solutions</title>
    <p>
      You may be wondering: if a permissible potential function is found that satisfies the necessary boundary conditions, can we be certain it is the unique solution in the problem (up to a constant)? You may understand the construction of potentials, via the method of images, but perhaps irked that it involves the insertion of these so-called 'fictitious' points. The answer, at least for most non-pathological problems in potential flow theory (i.e. all the problems you study) is <em>yes</em>, the solution you have found is assured to be the only solution (up to a constant).</p> 
      
     <p> This is, to some extent, related to the <url href="https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Uniqueness_of_Analytic_Continuation">uniqueness of analytic continuation</url>. In a nutshall, the relevant theorem states that given two admissible complex potentials, say <m>f_1(z)</m> and <m>f_2(z)</m>, that agree on the line <m>x = 0</m> (in the case of the above situation), it is the case that <m>f_1 = f_2</m> everywhere (where they are analytic). 
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, you can be certain that solutions you find via the trick of method of images are the only solutions.

  <title>Conformal mapping</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      The essential idea of conformal mapping is as follows. Suppose that we are given a two-dimensional potential fluid flow problem in a region, <m>R \subseteq \mathbb{C}</m>, with impermeable boundary <m>\partial R</m>. There may be singularities in <m>R</m> corresponding to sinks, sources, vortices, etc. We then seek a <em>conformal mapping</em> from the <m>z</m>-plane to the <m>\zeta</m>-plane via
      <me>
        \zeta = g(z),
      </me>
      so that the region <m>R</m> is mapped to a new region <m>\hat{R} \subseteq \mathbb{C}</m>, as shown in <xref ref="fig-conformal-general"/>.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The hope is that within the <m>\zeta</m>-plane, the fluid region is sufficiently simple that a complex potential, say <m>F(\zeta)</m>, can be found. This task is aided by virtue of the fact that sinks/sources and vortices are preserved by the conformal map. Typically, we wish for <m>\hat{R}</m> to be e.g. the upper half-plane or the unit disc, with <m>\partial\hat{R}</m> to be the real axis or circumferance of the unit disc, respectively. Once found, the complex potential in the <m>z</m>-plane is then obtained simply by inverting the conformal map, i.e. 
      <me>
        f(z) = F(g(\zeta)) = \phi(x, y) + \im \psi(x, y).
      </me>
      This simple idea turns out to yield many insights to potential flows in two dimensions.

    <title>Source in a wedge</title>

    <p>
      Consider fluid contained in a wedge with walls at <m>\theta = 0</m> and <m>\theta = \alpha > 0</m>, and with the fluid in <m>0 &lt; \theta &lt; \alpha</m>. A source of strength <m>Q</m> is placed somewhere within the flow, say at the point <m>z = c</m>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider then the map 
      <men xml:id="eqn-conformal-wedge-map">
       \zeta = g(z) = z^{\pi/\alpha}.
      </men>
      It can be verified that this map transforms the fluid region to the upper half-<m>\zeta</m>-plane. Indeed the ray <m>\theta = 0</m> is mapped to the positive real axis and the ray <m>\theta = \alpha</m> is mapped to the negative real axis. This is shown in <xref ref="fig-conformal-wedge"/>.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id="fig-conformal-wedge">
      <caption>The map from the wedge-shaped region in the <m>z</m>-plane (left) and the upper half-<m>\zeta</m>-plane (right). </caption>

        <shortdescription>conformal map</shortdescription>
      </image>
    </figure>

    <p>
      In the <m>\zeta</m>-plane, the fluid problem thus consists of solving for flow in the upper half-plane with a source of strength <m>Q</m> at the location <m>\zeta = c^{\pi/\alpha} = \zeta_c</m>, with an impermeable boundary on the real <m>\zeta</m>-axis. Indeed, from the previous section, we know this can be solved using the method of images, with a source placed at both the point <m>\zeta_c</m> and its complex conjugate point, <m>\overline{\zeta_c}</m>. It then follows that the complex potential is 
      <men xml:id="eqn-conformal-zeta-wedge">
       F(\zeta) = \frac{Q}{2\pi} \log(\zeta - \zeta_c) + \frac{Q}{2\pi} \log(\zeta - \overline{\zeta_c}).
      </men>
     We can then invert the above formula, expressing the complex potential in the <m>z</m>-plane as 
     <men xml:id="eqn-conformal-z-wedge">
      f(z) = F(g(z)) = \frac{Q}{2\pi} \log(z^{\pi/\alpha} - c^{\pi/\alpha}) + \frac{Q}{2\pi} \log(z^{\pi/\alpha} - \overline{c^{\pi/\alpha}}).
     </men>
    </p>

    <p>
      We can verify with a computational plot that this complex potential indeed seems to duplicate the necessary fluid flow within the wedge.

    The <em>exponential map</em> is used to map a channel to a half-space. Consider a channel of width <m>h</m> in the region <m>0 &lt; \Im z &lt; h</m> in the <m>z</m>-plane. Then 
    <men xml:id="eqn-conformal-exp-map">

The correspondence of critical points and points at infinity in the pre-image and the image is shown in <xref ref="eqn-conformal-exp-map"/>. It is good to see the map as essentially 'unfolding' the infinite channel, sending points AD to the origin, while sending B to negative infinity and C to positive infinity. The conformal map will preserve the orientation of the boundary, so as we traverse along ABCD, the fluid region is always on the left.

    <title>Basic calculations</title>
    <introduction>

      <p>
        The following question relates to two-dimensional potential flow.  Remember that the fluid flux through a surface given by contour <m>C</m> is given by <xref ref="eqn-2d-flux"/>, or
        <me>
          \int_C \bu \cdot \bn \, \de{s}.
        </me>
        You will get some practice on calculating this quantity below. 
      </p>

      <p>
        We can also calculate the total force on the surface specified by <m>C</m> by using the integral in <xref ref="eqn-total-force"/>. Since the force in potential flow is given by <xref ref="thm-inviscid-force"/>, then the total force is 
        <me>
          \text{total force} = \int_C (-p\bn) \, \de{s}
        </me>
       where <m>p</m> is the pressure force given by Bernoulli's equation: 
       <me>
        p = p_0 - \frac{\rho}{2} |\bu|^2,
       </me>
       and <m>p_0</m> is a reference value and we ignore gravity.
      </p>


      <p>
      For each of the following elementary flows, state or calculate: 

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
             the complex potential, <m>f(z)</m>; 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            the velocity vector, written in vector form <m>\bu = [u, v]</m>;
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            the flux and fluid force on a surface consisting of a circle of unit radius;
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>Hint:</em> the unit normal for the circle is <m>\bn = [\cos\theta, \sin\theta]</m>; when converting to polar coordinates remember that <m>\de{s} = r\de{\theta}</m>.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
           the flux and fluid force on a surface consisting of a plate given by the line <m>y = -x + 1</m> with <m>x > 0</m>.  
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Uniform flow of velocity <m>U</m> oriented at an angle of <m>\pi/4</m> to the horizontal. 
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          (i) complex potential given in the notes is <me>f(z) = U\e^{-\im\alpha}z = U\e^{-\im \pi/4}z</me>;</p>
          
        <p>(ii) complex velocity is given by <m>f'(z) = u - \im v = U\e^{-\im \pi/4}</m>. Writing out the velocity components in vector form, we have 
        <me>
          \bu = U \Bigl[ \cos(\pi/4), \, \sin(\pi/4) \Bigr] = U \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \Bigl[1, 1\Bigr].
        </me>
        
        </p>

        <p>
          (iii) We expect the flux past a circle will be zero (since the flow will enter one side and exit the other). The flux is given by 
          <me>
            \int_{r = 1} \bu \cdot \bn \, \de{s} = U\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \int_0^{2\pi} [1, 1] \cdot [\cos\theta, \sin\theta] \de{\theta} = 0.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          The force is given by 
          <me>
          \bF_{\text{total}} = \left(\frac{\rho}{2} U^2 - p_0\right) \int_0^{2\pi} [\cos\theta, \sin\theta] \, \de{\theta} = [0, 0]. 
          </me>
          The total force again is zero since the force on the two hemispheres will cancel themselves out.
        </p>

        <p>
          (iv) The normal of the plate is given by 
          <me>\bn = \frac{[1, 1]}{\sqrt{2}}</me> 
          (here we assume this normal is pointing 'out'). We can parameterise the plate using a vector equation for the position vector:
          <me>
            \br(t) = [t, -t + 1], \quad 0 \leq t \leq 1,
          </me>
          since the equation of the line is <m>y = -x + 1</m>. Then 
          <me>
            |\br'(t)| = |[1, -1]| = \sqrt{2}. 
          </me>
          So the surface conversion is 
          <me>
            \de{s} = |\br'(t)| \, \de{t} = \sqrt{2} \de{t}.
          </me>
          The flux is then 
          <me>
            U\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \int_{t = 0}^1 \frac{[1, 1]}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot [1, 1] \sqrt{2} \de{t} = \sqrt{2}U.
          </me>
          The above makes perfect sense. The fluid is entirely normal to the plate, and the plate has length <m>\sqrt{2}</m>. 
        </p>

        <p>
          For the force, remember that the pressure is constant, since the speed is constant. Thus 
          <me>
            \bF_{\text{total}}= \left(\frac{\rho}{2}U^2 - p_0\right) \int_0^1 \frac{[1, 1]}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \, \sqrt{2} \, \de{t} =\left(\frac{\rho}{2}U^2 - p_0\right) [1, 1].

    <title>Doublet</title>
   
    <introduction>
      <p>
        A line source of strength <m>Q</m> is at <m>z = a</m> and a line sink of the same strength is at <m>z = -a</m> where <m>a > 0</m>. 
      </p>
    </introduction>

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Write down the complex potential, <m>f(z)</m>. Find <m>f'(z)</m>. Locate any stagnation points and derive an equation for the streamlines of the flow. Finally, use a plotter, such as the one at <url href="https://potentialflow.com/">the potential flow simulator</url> to sketch the streamlines. 
        </p>
      </statement>

      <answer>
        <p>
          The complex potential is the sum of a line source and line sink:
          <me>
            f(z) = \frac{Q}{2\pi} [\log(z - a) - \log(z + a)].
          </me>
          Therefore the complex velocity is given by 
          <me>
            f'(z) = \frac{Q}{2\pi} \left[ \frac{1}{z-a} - \frac{1}{z+a}\right].
          </me>
          Stagnation points are where <m>f'(z) = 0</m>. There are no stagnation points. The streamfunction is given by 
          <me>
            \Im f = \frac{Q}{2\pi}(\theta_1 - \theta_2), 
          </me> 
          where <m>\theta_1</m> and <m>\theta_2</m> are angles measured relative to the positions about <m>\pm a</m>. Thus,
          <me>
            \theta_{1,2} = \tan^{-1} \left( \frac{y}{x \mp a} \right).
          </me>
         The streamlines are given where <m>\psi</m> is constant. The streamlines are shown below.
      </p>

  </task>

    <task>
      <statement>
        <p>
    Let <m>a \to 0</m> and <m>Q \to \infty</m> while keeping the product <m>aQ</m> fixed. This gives the flow due to a <em>doublet</em><idx><h>doublet</h></idx>. Show that its complex potential is <m>\mu/z</m> where <m>\mu</m> is expressed in terms of <m>a</m> and <m>Q</m>. It will be useful for you to use the fact that 
   <me>
    \log(1 + \alpha) = \alpha + O(\alpha^2)
   </me>
   considered as an appropriate approximation when <m>\alpha</m> is small. 
    
    Show that the streamlines are circles through the origin with centres on the <m>y</m>-axis.           
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          Expanding the logarithms for small <m>a</m> gives
          <me>
            \log z - \log z + \log(1 - a/z) - \log(1 + a/z) \sim -\frac{2a}{z}.
          </me>
         Thus in the limit <m>a \to 0</m>, we have
         <me>
          f(z) \sim -\frac{Qa}{\pi} \frac{1}{z}.
         </me>
         Therefore, we let both <m>a \to 0</m> and <m>Q \to \infty</m> in a fashion such that <m>m = aQ</m> is fixed. We then have the potential
         <me>
          f(z) = \frac{\mu}{z}
         </me>
         where <m>\mu = -Qa/\pi.</m>

      <title>A line source in a flow; stagnation points</title>

      <statement>
        <p>
              Incompressible inviscid fluid occupies the region <m>y > 0</m>, and there is a rigid plane
wall at <m>y = 0</m>. There is a uniform flow, speed <m>U</m>, in the positive <m>x</m>-direction, and a
line source of strength <m>Q</m> at <m>(0, a)</m>, where <m>a &gt; 0</m>. Find the complex potential <m>f(z)</m>
and calculate <m>f'(z)</m>. Let <m>\beta = Q/(2\pi aU)</m>. Show that if <m>\beta &gt; 1</m> there are two stagnation
points, both on the wall, while if <m>\beta &lt; 1</m> there is only one, in the fluid, a distance <m>a</m>
from the origin. Try to sketch the streamlines in either case  
        </p>
      </statement>

      <solution>
        <p>
          The potential is given by 
          <me>
            f(z) = Uz + \frac{Q}{2\pi} [\log(z - a\im) + \log(z + a\im)] = Uz + \frac{Q}{2\pi} \log(z^2 + a^2).
          </me>
          The complex velocity is then 
          <me>
            f'(z) = U + \frac{Qz}{\pi(z^2 + a^2)}.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          A stagnation point requires <m>f'(z) = 0</m> and so we solve the resultant quadratic to obtain 
          <me>
            z = \frac{-Q \pm \sqrt{Q^2 - (2a\pi U)^2}}{2\pi U}.
          </me>
          Setting <m>\beta = Q/(2\pi a U)</m>, there are two real roots if <m>\beta &gt; 1</m>. Hence this is the case of two stagnation points along the axis. If <m>\beta &lt; 1</m>, then there two complex conjugate points, and hence only one stagnation point in the flow field.
