<preface xml:id="history"><title>History of the unit</title>
<p>
Previously at Bath in the Mathematical Sciences, there were two units meant to teach continuum and fluid mechanics (or dynamics) to students. Prior to 2025, there was the <url href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/catalogues/2024-2025/ma/MA30253.html" visual="https://www.bath.ac.uk/catalogues/2024-2025/ma/MA30253.html">MA30253 Continuum Mechanics</url> module. This was then continued into the <url href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/catalogues/2024-2025/ma/MA40255.html" visual="https://www.bath.ac.uk/catalogues/2024-2025/ma/MA40255.html">MA40255 Viscous fluid dynamics</url> module. 
</p>

<p>
As part of the curriculum transformation (with the first change to Year 3 in 2025), we are attempting to unify these two treatments, providing a more streamlined teaching of elementary fluid dynamics, which is oriented towards a broad range of styles of emphasis, from applied mathematics, to physics and engineering. The hope is that this new course on Fluid Dynamics provides you with a strong foundation in different basic fluid flows and their mathematical formulation and study. 
</p>


<!-- <paragraphs><title>Changes in 2024<ndash/>2025</title><p>
  Probably the most visible change this year is that I have condensed all
  variants of the weak maximum principle into a single theorem , and similarly for the strong maximum Principe, Hopf lemma,
  and parabolic weak maximum principle. Lectures in recent years have been
  drifting towards this style, and the hope is that it will ultimately
  streamline the presentation. Also:
<ul><li>
  During the semester last year, I added a paragraph was added on treating formulas as
  functions. This is perhaps the main place where the conventions in this
  unite differ from those in MA30252. 
</li><li>
  There is a new sentence inmaking it more explicit
  how the zeroth-order partial <m>∂^0</m> is to be interpreted. I have also
  added an additional displayed equation below  to
  further emphasize the meaning of the zeroth-order term <m>c</m>.
</li><li>
</li><li>
  Further changes made during the semester will be recorded in 
</li></ul>

<preface><title>Related units at Bath</title>
<p>
We will only mention units from Year 2 onwards in this. Apart from the key pre-requisites of MA22016 (Differential equations and vector calculus) and/or MA20223 (the older Vector calculus and partial differential equations), we make an effort to keep the material in the module self-contained. You are recommended to have taken MA22021 (partial differential equations). </p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <title>MA22016: Differential equations and vector calculus</title>
  <p>
    <url href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/catalogues/2024-2025/ma/MA22016.html">This unit</url> forms a standard second-year module on differential equations and vector calculus, and is a key pre-requisite for this module. In addition to teaching and reviewing basic techniques for solving ordinary differential equations, you will learn about some of the core methods in vector calculus (directional derivatives; gradients; potentials; line integrals; divergence; curl; surface and volume integrals; curvilinear coordinates; integral theorems). 
  </p>

  <p>
    Note prior to curriculum transformation, this would have been part of the MA20223 unit (with additional material from the below MA22021).
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <title>MA22021: Partial differential equations</title>
  <p>
 <url href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/catalogues/2024-2025/ma/MA22021.html" >This module</url> teaches basic techniques and theory for the core PDEs (Laplace, heat, wave equations). Generally, we will make with your broad familiarity of PDE different equation types and terminology (e.g. boundary conditions). This unit will be useful, as it will teach you some basic familiarity with partial differential equations. However, the current fluid dynamics module assumes you may not have taken it, and attempts to fill in any necessary gaps.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <title>MA32045: Complex analysis</title><p>
 <url href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/catalogues/2025-2026/ma/MA32045.html" >This module</url> covers some of the theory and applications behind complex-valued functions. You will have encountered complex functions, e.g. <m>f(z) = z^2, \e^z, \log z, \ldots</m> in an <em>ad-hoc</em> way, perhaps in earlier courses on Analysis. Again, we will attempt to cover all the necessary pre-requisites, and also provide you with helpful references. 
  </p>
</li>
<!-- <li>
  <title>MA30044: Mathematical methods 1</title><p>
    This applied unit covers quasilinear first-order PDEs, the
    Cauchy<ndash/>Kovalevskaya theorem, classification of equations as
    elliptic/parabolic/hyperbolic and d'Alembert's solution for the
    one-dimensional wave equation.
  </p>
</li><li>
  <title>MA30252: Advanced real analysis</title><p>
    This pure unit is a prerequisite for MA40203. It shows that <m>C^k([a,b])</m>
    is a Banach space, defines the Hilbert space <m>L^2(a,b)</m> as a completion,
    and proves the Arzelà<ndash/>Ascoli and Weierstrass approximation theorems.
  </p>
</li><li>
  <title>MA30253: Continuum mechanics</title><p>
    Introduces a variety of PDEs, including Euler's equations for inviscid fluids,
    and studies them from an applied point of view.
  </p>
</li><li>
  <title>MA30170: Numerical solution of elliptic PDEs </title><p>
    Introduces variational and weak forms of elliptic PDEs, and how to solve them
    numerically using finite element methods.
  </p>
</li><li>

    Covers numerical methods for parabolic and hyperbolic PDEs.
  </p>
</li><li>
  <title>MA30059: Mathematical methods 2</title><p>
    An applied unit which often covers more advanced techniques for the
    Laplace and heat equations, for instance Green's functions and separation
    of variables for inhomogeneous systems. May also cover the calculus of
    variations, which is an important source of PDEs.
  </p>
</li><li>
  <title>MA30063: Mathematical biology 2</title><p>
    This applied unit concerns the modelling and analysis of PDEs arising in
    biology.
  </p>
</li><li>
  <title>MA40256: Analysis in Hilbert spaces</title><p>
    This pure unit studies linear mappings between Hilbert spaces, which is
    an abstract setting often used to study PDEs. Potential topics include the
    Lax<ndash/>Milgram theorem, which is a powerful tool to show the existence
    of solutions to certain PDEs. (MA40256 and MA40057 are offered in
    alternating years.)
  </p>
</li><li>
  <title>MA40049: Elasticity</title><p>
    Another applied unit with many connections to PDEs.
  </p>
</li><li>
  <title>MA40042: Measure theory &amp; integration</title><p>
    Provides a detailed description of the function spaces <m>L^p</m> for <m>1
    ≤ p ≤ ∞</m>, which are very useful in the study of PDEs.
  </p>
</li><li>
  <title>MA40057: Functional analysis</title><p>
    This pure unit studies linear operators between Banach spaces, which is
    another commonly-used abstract setting for PDEs. Covers weak and weak-*
    convergence, which are often used to show existence of solutions to PDEs.
    (MA40256 and MA40057 are offered in alternating years.)
  </p>
</li><li>
  There are also connections to some of the higher-level probability units
  through the Feynman<ndash/>Kac formula, Fokker<ndash/>Plank equations, and
  of course stochastic PDEs.
</li><li>
  There are also connections to the units on ordinary differential
  equations and dynamical systems, especially some of the higher-level units
  with a focus rigorous existence and/or qualitative properties of solutions.

</ul>
</p>
<!-- <p>
In this unit:
<ul><li>
  We will study PDEs from a pure rather than applied point of view. We will
  not do any modelling, nor indeed spend much time at all motivating the PDEs
  we study. Instead, we will spend a lot of time working through rigorous
  proofs with <m>ε</m>s, <m>δ</m>s, and convergent subsequences of functions.
</li><li>
  On the other hand we will not use tools from Functional analysis, Hilbert
  space theory or Measure theory &amp; integration.
</li><li>
  We will consider second-order PDEs on quite general domains and with quite
  general coefficients. Such equations cannot be solved explicitly using
  separation of variables or Green's functions techniques. Instead, we focus
  on qualitative properties such as existence, uniqueness and symmetry.
</li><li>
  Rather than attempt a broad survey, we will focus almost exclusively on a
  single tool, the maximum principle, and develop it to a high level of
  sophistication.

    There are countless fluid mechanics or fluid dynamics courses and textbooks,
    and for the most part, the development of a <em>first course</em> on fluid dynamics
    tends to be quite similar between universities and treatments.
    If you would like additional references, here are a few useful ones.</p>

          have been developed simultaneous to the design of this book by Acheson
