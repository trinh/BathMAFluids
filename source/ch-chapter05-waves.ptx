  <title>Water waves</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>In the mid-nineteenth century, George Gabriel Stokes made significant contributions to the
      study of water waves, establishing much of the theoretical foundation that underpins modern
      fluid mechanics. His analysis of periodic, finite-amplitude waves on the surface of an
      incompressible fluid led to what are now known as <em>Stokes waves</em>, which describe how
      real waves deviate from purely sinusoidal motion as their amplitude increases. Stokesâ€™ work
      marked a shift from qualitative observation to quantitative description, providing a
      systematic framework for understanding the balance of gravity, inertia, and nonlinearity in
      wave motion.</p>

    <p>Our main task in this chapter is to introduce the fundamental principles governing water
      waves and the mathematical models that describe their behavior across different regimes.</p>
  </introduction>

  <section xml:id="sec-waterwaves-equations">
    <title>Governing equations of water waves</title>

    <p> We shall consider the case of waves on the free surface of a two-dimensional potential fluid
      (hence inviscid, incompressible, and irrotational). The free surface bounds the water from above, and is assumed to be given by 
      <me> 
        y = \eta(x, t) \qquad -\infty &lt; x &lt; \infty.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Since the fluid satisfies the assumptions of potential flow, there exists a velocity potential <m>\bu = \nabla \phi</m> where
      <me>
      \nabla^2 \phi = \pd{^2 \phi}{x^2} + \pd{^2\phi}{y^2} = 0 \qquad \text{in the fluid}.   
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      What makes water-wave problems unique (and challenging) is that not only do we need to solve for the potential (and hence velocities) within the fluid, as given by Laplace's equation above, but that we must do so in an <em>a priori</em> unknown domain, where the free-surface location <m>y = \eta(x, t)</m> must also be solved in parallel. Key considerations, then, must relate to the precise boundary conditions to impose.
    </p>

    <subsection xml:id="subsec-waterwaves-boundaryconditions">
      <title>Boundary conditions</title>

      <p>
        If we consider waves on a fluid of infinite (or deep) depth, then far below the free surface, we expect that the velocity tends to zero. Hence a suitable boundary condition is
        <men xml:id="eqn-waterwaves-farfield-infinite">
          \bu = \nabla \phi \to 0 \quad \text{as $y \to -\infty$}.
        </men>
      </p>

      <p>
        On the other hand, for the case of fluid bounded below by a flat bed, say at <m>y = -H</m>, we have
        <men xml:id="eqn-waterwaves-bottom">
          \bu \cdot \bn = 0 \Longrightarrow \pd{\phi}{y} = 0 \qquad \text{on $y = -H$}. 
        </men>

      <title>Derivation of the kinematic condition</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          In this question, you will derive the kinematic boundary condition on a free surface, which ensures that fluid particles on the free surface must remain on the free surface. Consider a vector that points to a location on a 2D free surface given by 
          <me>
        \br(s, t) = (x, \eta(x, t)).
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Introduce the curve <m>F(x, y, t) = y - \eta(x, t)</m>. For any particle on the surface, it must be the case that <m>F(x, y, t) \equiv 0</m>. By applying the material derivative show that the condition that 
            <me>
              \DD{F}{t} = 0,
            </me>
            for particles on the free surface is equivalent to the kinematic condition 
            <me>
              v = \pd{\eta}{t} + u\pd{\eta}{x} \qquad \text{on $y = \eta(x, t)$}.
            </me>
          </p>
        </statement>

          <solution>
            <p> 
              By the definition of the material derivative, we have that
              <me>
                \DD{(y - \eta)}{t} = \pd{(y - \eta)}{t} + (u, v) \cdot \nabla(y - \eta) = -\pd{\eta}{t} + (u, v) \cdot (-\eta_x, 1).
              </me>
             Equating the above to zero for the case of <m>y = \eta(x, t)</m> yields the desired result.
            </p>

      <title>Stokes waves</title>
      <p>
        Consider small 2D water waves on the free surface of a potential (incompressible and irrotational) fluid with velocity potential <m>\phi(x, y,t)</m>, with <m>\phi</m> satisfying <m>\nabla^2 \phi = 0</m>. Let the free surface be at <m>y = \eta(x, t)</m> and assume the water is confined above a flat channel of depth <m>y = -h</m>. Show that on the free surface, <m>y = \eta(x, t)</m>, the two governing equations are given by:
        <md>
          <mrow>\pd{\phi}{y} \amp= \pd{\eta}{t} + \pd{\phi}{x}\pd{\eta}{x}, </mrow>
          <mrow>\pd{\phi}{t} + \frac{1}{2}|\nabla \phi|^2 + g\eta \amp= 0. </mrow>
        </md>
      </p>
     
      <p>
        Show that when the problem is linearised by ignoring quadratic terms, then instead the boundary conditions can be simplified to be 
        <md>
          <mrow>\pd{\phi}{y} \amp= \pd{\eta}{t}, </mrow>
          <mrow>\pd{\phi}{t} + g\eta \amp= 0, </mrow>
        </md>
        and now applied on <m>y = 0</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Show that travelling harmonic waves, with <m>\eta = AA\cos(kx - \omega t)</m> and <m>\phi = f(y)\sin(kx - \omega t)</m>, are possible and derive the associated dispersion relation,

      <title>Fluids of different densities</title>
      <p>
        Inviscid incompressible fluid of density <m>\rho_2</m> lies in the region <m>y &gt; 0</m> above a fluid with greater density <m>\rho_1</m> for <m>y &lt; 0</m>. Assume there there is a small-amplitude disturbance the two fluids with the surface given by <m>y = \eta(x, t)</m>. Assuming <m>\eta</m> and the fluid velocities are small, derive the three linearised boundary conditions on the approximated boundary at <m>y = 0</m>.
