  <title>Viscous flows</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this chapter we introduce the effects of viscosity into our fluid model. This
      leads to the famous Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations, which are the governing equations for
      many fluid flows of practical interest. The viscosity has a profound
      effect on the flow, and it can lead to the formation of boundary layers and the generation
      of vorticity at solid boundaries.

    Viscous flows are ubiquitous in nature and industry. Examples include the flow of blood
    through arteries and veins, the flow of air over aircraft wings, and the flow of water
    around ship hulls. Viscosity is also important in many industrial processes, such as
    the manufacture of paints, adhesives, and food products.

    <title>Viscosity</title>
    <p>
        Viscosity quantifies the fluid's internal resistance to flow when a force is applied
        (the higher the resistance the higher the viscosity). One of the most common
        mathematical models of an idealised fluid is a
        <em>Newtonian</em> fluid. For these fluids the shear viscosity
        <m>\mu</m> (sometimes called dynamic viscosity, or just viscosity) is a scalar quantity.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example-viscosity">
      <p>
        We could imagine a thought experiment to measure the shear viscosity of a fluid as follows, see
        also <xref ref="fig-viscosity-measurement"/>.       
        <figure xml:id="fig-viscosity-measurement">

      </figure>
        A solid block of area <m>A</m> floats on the surface of a thin layer of the fluid of
        thickness <m>h</m>. The block is pushed with a force <m>F</m> parallel to the surface of the fluid,
        causing it to move with a steady velocity <m>U</m>. The shear viscosity is given by
        <me>
          \mu = \frac{F h}{A U}.
        </me>
        In principle this formula could be used to determine the viscosity of a fluid
        experimentally; however, in practice it is more common to use a falling ball viscometer (see
        <xref ref="ps-falling-ball-viscometer"/> in the worksheet at the end of this chapter).

        It is sometimes more convenient to work in terms of the kinematic viscosity <m>\nu</m> (measured in

        Many real fluids have more complicated viscosity
        properties, for example blood, mucus, shampoo, egg white and custard.
        In this course we mainly consider Newtonian fluids, thereby avoiding a lot of complexity!

          Note that we have not yet formally defined the shear viscosity, although the
          example given in <xref ref="example-viscosity"/> provides an informal definition.
          This concept will be formalised in <xref ref="sec-stress"/>.

<subsection xml:id="reynolds-number">
    <title>Reynolds number</title>
    <p>
        This is one of the most important flow parameters in the study of fluid dynamics,
        as its order of magnitude determines many of the qualitative features of the flow.
        In a given flow, it quantifies the relative importance of inertial and viscous effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      <definition>
        <title>The Reynolds number</title>
           <p>
        The Reynolds number is a dimensionless quantity, defined by
    <me>
        \textrm{Re} = \frac{\rho U L}{\mu} = \frac{U L}{\nu},
    </me>
        where <m>U</m> is a <em>characteristic</em> (or typical) velocity of the flow
        and <m>L</m> is a <em>characteristic</em> lengthscale. It equals the typical size
        of an inertial acceleration divided by a typical size of a viscous acceleration in the flow.

        <p>
          <remark>
            <title>Choice of characteristic scales</title>
            <p>
            What do we pick as the <em>characteristic</em> length and velocity scales?
            This is something that gets easier with increasing experience.
            For a given problem there are usually ‘natural’ scales that arise within it.
            </p>
            <p>
              <example xml:id="example-choice-of-scales">
                <title>Illustrative example of choice of scales</title>
                <p>
                  As an illustrative example of how we might think about choosing suitable scales,
                  consider a steady flow along a pipe with a circular
            cross-section. An appropriate choice of <m>L</m> could be the pipe radius
            or diameter, while an appropriate value of <m>U</m> could be the velocity
            along the centreline (axis) of the pipe or the average velocity across
            the pipe cross-section (equal to the volumetric flux (volume per unit time)
            of fluid passing along the pipe divided by the cross-sectional area of the pipe).
                </p>
              </example>
            </p>
                <p>
            Different choices of scales (radius vs. diameter and of centreline vs. average velocity
            in <xref ref="example-choice-of-scales"/>)
            would lead to different numerical values of <m>\textrm{Re}</m>. However, note:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The order of magnitude of the Reynolds number is the same for all choices.
                  Thus, when describing a flow, the value of <m>\textrm{Re}</m> is often
                  quoted as an order-of-magnitude property.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                    If we give detailed information about exactly which
                    length and velocity scales are being used then
                    we can directly compare different values of <m>\textrm{Re}</m>,
                    even if they are of the same order of magnitude.
                    For example, we might do this in a plot of a property
                    of the flow against the Reynolds number. In this case,
                    it would be good scientific practice to specify the
                    choice of velocity and length scales used.

            <title>Flow characteristics at different Reynolds numbers</title>
            <p>
          Typical characteristics of the flow are strongly associated with the order of magnitude
          of the Reynolds number:

            <li>
                <p><em>Low-Reynolds-number flows (<m>Re \ll 1</m>):</em>
                <ul>
                    <li>Examples include several biological examples, such as flow in capillaries
                      (the smallest blood vessels) swimming bacteria or other single cell organisms,
                      lymphatic system flow, and other examples include microfluidics,

                    <li>These flows are called Stokes flows (after G. G. Stokes who studied them) or creeping flows.</li>
                    <li>Low-Reynolds-number flows are also reversible, meaning that if a force is applied,

                    <li>Flows in pipes with moderate Reynolds number are often described as <em>laminar</em>,
                      meaning that the fluid moves in ‘layers’ sliding past each other
                      (in fluid dynamics, the word ‘laminar’ is often used to mean that the flow
                      is not <em>turbulent</em>).</li>

        <title>Turbulent flow</title>
        <p>
          This is a qualitative type of flow that is characterised as having many
          different length scales, and the flow is mathematically <em>chaotic</em>.
            Chaotic flow means that fluid particles that start close together can become
            widely separated over time. As well as the scale of the whole experiment,
            the turbulence has eddies on all small length scales.
            Turbulent flows are analysed mathematically by decomposing the fluid velocity into a
            <em>mean flow</em>, which describes the large-scale flow and a <em>fluctuating flow</em>,
            which describes the eddies. Equations can be written for each of these,
            but this decomposition leads to the so-called <em>closure problem</em>,
            in which an assumption needs to be made to provide a final equation that
            governs the dynamics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Turbulence is of great importance in applications such as aeronautical
            engineering, weather forecasting and large-scale industrial flows,
            basically because large and fast moving flows have a sufficiently high Reynolds
            number that turbulence is unavoidable and it dominates the flow
            characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>
            The study of turbulence could constitute a lecture course in its own right,
            and therefore a detailed analysis is beyond the scope of this course.
            <!--However, some of the material in this course is relevant to turbulent flows.
            For example the result by von Kármán about developing boundary layers that
            is described in <xref ref="sect:linmtmcons"/> on
            <pageref ref="page:vonkarmanlayer"/> is one that was famously first developed
            to analyse turbulent flows.-->

  <title>State relations</title>
  <p>
    In addition to the balances implied by mass and momentum conservation that
    you have so far been working on in this course, there is an additional condition needed,
    and this is called
    a <em>state relation</em>. This relates the thermodynamic variables density <m>\rho</m>,
    pressure <m>p</m> and temperature <m>T</m>. In this section, we give two of the most
    common state relations that are used mathematically, the first for liquids and the second for gases.

  <subsubsection>
    <title>Liquids</title>
    <p>
      Liquids are often assumed to be incompressible, that is we assume
      <m>\rho = \textrm{constant}</m>.
      This is the most common assumption made in this course. However, it is important
      to be aware that it is not always appropriate.
    </p>

    <p>
    <remark>
      <p>
      One of the most common reasons that making the assumption <m>\rho = \textrm{constant}</m>
      does not capture the flow dynamics accurately is if there are significant
      temperature variations within the liquid.
      Typically, liquids expand as the temperature rises, and this leads to <em>thermal convection</em>,
      which needs to be taken into account in the mathematical analysis.

            In the buoyancy term of the momentum conservation equation
      (that is the term <m>\rho g</m> appearing in the Euler equation),
      we assume the density is a linear function of the
      temperature. Thus we write
      <me>\rho = \rho_0(1 - \alpha(T - T_0))</me>,
      where <m>T_0</m> and <m>\rho_0</m>
      are a reference temperature and density, respectively, and <m>\alpha</m> is the

      Prove that this is equivalent to <xref ref="eqn-idealgas"/>.</p>
      <answer>
        <p>
          The relationship <m>pV=nRT</m> implies

          since <m>nM</m> is the mass of the gas molecules in <m>V</m> and therefore <m>nM/V</m>
          is the average density.
        </p>
      </answer>
      <p>In fluid dynamics the form <xref ref="eqn-idealgas"/> is more convenient than <m>pV=nRT</m>
        because it can be applied at each point in the gas, whereas <m>pV=nRT</m> is a law applying

        It is observed empirically that Newtonian viscous fluids interact with
        solid boundaries in such a way that
      <me>
          \bu_{\textrm{fluid}} = \bu_{\textrm{wall}}
      </me>
        are satisfied. This condition on the velocity components is called the
        <em>no-slip condition</em>. When solving problems in fluid
        mechanics we usually apply these relationships to provide boundary conditions.

  <p>
    <remark>
      <p>
        In many cases, <m>\bu_{\textrm{wall}} = \boldsymbol{0}</m>, so the no-slip conditions mean
        that the velocity is zero at the boundaries.

        In the previous sections of the course, you studied <em>inviscid fluids</em>,
        for which the boundary conditions was
        <me>
          \bu_{\textrm{fluid}}\cdot\bn=\bu_{\textrm{wall}}\cdot\bn.
        </me>
        Note that this condition is weaker than the corresponding one for viscous fluids,
        since it only applies to one component of the velocity.
        As we will shortly see, the extra conditions for viscous fluids are mathematically necessary,
        since the equation for conservation of momentum for viscous fluids has spatial derivatives
        of higher order.

    <title>Force balance at the boundary/interface</title>
    <p>
      In addition to the boundary conditions on the velocity given in
      <xref ref="boundary-conditions-velocity"/>, we sometimes need to apply a <em>force balance</em>
      condition at the boundary of the fluid or at the interface between two fluids in a
      free boundary problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      <remark><title>Rigid boundaries</title>
        <p>
        Thankfully, in the case of a fluid<ndash/>solid boundary, if the solid is rigid
        (which we often assume), the no-slip
        boundary conditions on the velocity are sufficient to solve the problem mathematically.
        If desired, a force balance can be performed after solving the problem, and this determines
        the <em>stress</em> (force per unit area) that the fluid exerts on the solid wall, and we
        can thus find the <em>reaction force</em> that the wall applies in order to maintain
        its position in the presence of the flowing fluid.          
        </p>
      </remark>
    </p>
    <p>
        However, if the solid <em>moves in response to the fluid</em>, either because it is an elastic solid
        or because the solid is not <em>tethered</em>,
        then a force balance is required to solve the problem mathematically. This is
        called a <em>fluid<ndash/>structure interaction problem</em>, and these are typically very difficult to solve.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, at a fluid<ndash/>fluid interface, a force balance is typically
        required to solve the problem. The difference between the stresses of the two
        fluids on the interface (the forces each fluid exerts on the interface per unit
        area of the interface) is balanced by the <em>surface tension</em> that arises
        within the interface.

      The interface between two immiscible fluids (e.g. air and water, or water and mercury) creates

      <title>Definition of stress at a surface</title>
      <p>
      The fluid stress on a surface is the force per unit area exerted
      by the fluid; note that this is a vector quantity.
      It is often convenient to decompose the stress into two contributions:
    <ul>
      <li>Shear stress: the components tangential to the surface</li>
      <li>Normal stress: the component perpendicular to the surface.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  </definition>
</p>
    
  <p>
    <example xml:id="example-shear-stress">
      <title>Fluid stress in arteries</title>
      <p>
      The shear stress on arterial walls is everywhere maintained
      at around <m>\sim1.5</m> Pa, whereas the normal stress is typically much larger at ~11–16 kPa.
      The distribution of shear stress distribution is known to be of great importance to our
      health as it is linked to the development of atherosclerosis, which leads to heart attacks
      and strokes, two of the leading causes of death worldwide.

        <li>The wall shear stress equals the fluid shear viscosity multiplied by the normal derivative of the tangential velocity.</li>
        <li>The normal stress equals the pressure.</li>

      Note that in 3D there are two shear components and one normal component.

For slowly moving spheres, the resistive force is given by Stokes
drag, and equals <m>3\pi\mu Du</m>, where <m>D</m> is the diameter of the sphere, <m>\mu</m>
is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, and <m>u</m> is the speed of the sphere
(this is a famous result).
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Check the dimensions of the Stokes drag. Is the dimension what you expect?
</p>
<answer>
<p>
The dimensions of the terms are as follows:
<me>
[3\pi]=1,\quad
[\mu]=ML^{-1}T^{-1},\quad
[D]=L,\quad
[u]=LT^{-1},
</me>
meaning that
<me>
\left[3\pi\mu Du\right]=1\times ML^{-1}T^{-1}\times L\times LT^{-1}
=MLT^{-2}.

Thus the expression <m>3\pi\mu Du</m> for the Stokes drag has the dimensions of force, as expected.

Given that the ballbearing is released from rest, solve the differential
equation to show that
<me>
u=u_t\left(1-e^{-t/\tau}\right),
</me>
where <m>u_t</m> and <m>\tau</m> are constant parameters that you should define.
What is the physical significance of <m>u_t</m> and <m>\tau</m>?
</p>
<answer>
<p>
We have
<me>
\frac{du}{dt}+\frac{3\pi\mu D}{m}u=g,
</me>
for which the integrating factor is <m>e^{\frac{3\pi\mu D}{m}t}</m>, and
<me>
ue^{\frac{3\pi\mu D}{m}t}=\int ge^{\frac{3\pi\mu D}{m}t}dt
=\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}e^{\frac{3\pi\mu D}{m}t}+c,
</me>
where <m>c</m> is a constant of integration. Hence
<me>
u=\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}+ce^{-\frac{3\pi\mu D}{m}t}
</me>
The initial condition is <m>u=0</m> at <m>t=0</m>, and, substituting this into the above equation,
<m>0=\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}+c</m>, giving <m>c=-\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}</m>. Hence
<me>
u=\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}\left(1-e^{-\frac{3\pi\mu D}{m}t}\right).
</me>
We substitute <m>u_t=\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}</m> and <m>\tau=\frac{m}{3\pi\mu D}</m>. With these substitutions we get
<me>
u=u_t\left(1-e^{-t/\tau}\right).
</me>
The physical significance of these choices is that <m>u_t</m> is the terminal velocity of the sphere and <m>\tau</m> is the timescale over which the velocity of the sphere approaches the terminal velocity. Every <m>\tau</m> units of time, the velocity of the sphere becomes closer to the terminal velocity <m>u_t</m> by a factor <m>e\approx2.7</m>.

Using the fact that the volume of a sphere is <m>\pi D^3/6</m>, where <m>D</m> is the diameter,
we have <m>m=\pi\rho_sD^3/6</m>, where <m>\rho_s=8,000</m> kg/m<m>^3</m>. Thus
<md>
<mrow>u_t=\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}=\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}=\frac{\rho_sgD^2}{18\mu}</mrow>

Comment on the experimental set up needed to measure the terminal velocity.

<answer>
<p>
The ball would attain its terminal velocity very quickly (in much less than a second),
and since <m>u_t</m> is on order of centimetres per second, a container of about 10 cm
deep would be suitable for measurement. In fact this idea is commonly used to measure
the viscosity of fluids (since the viscosity can be calculated from the terminal velocity);
this is called a <em>falling ball viscometer</em>.
