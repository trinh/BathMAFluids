  <title>Viscous flows</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this chapter we introduce the effects of viscosity into our fluid model. This
      leads to the famous Navier--Stokes equations, which are the governing equations for
      many fluid flows of practical interest. The viscosity has a profound
      effect on the flow, and it can lead to the formation of boundary layers and the generation
      of vorticity at solid boundaries.

    <title>Viscosity</title>
    <p>
        Viscosity quantifies the fluid's resistance to flow when a force is applied
        (the higher the resistance the higher the viscosity). One of the most common
        mathematical models of an idealised fluid is a
        <em>Newtonian</em> fluid. For these fluids the shear viscosity
        <m>\mu</m> (sometimes called dynamic viscosity, or just viscosity) is a scalar quantity.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example-viscosity">
      <p>
        We could imagine a thought experiment to measure the shear viscosity of a fluid as follows, see
        also <xref ref="fig-viscosity-measurement"/>.       
        <figure xml:id="fig-viscosity-measurement">

      </figure>
        A solid block of area <m>A</m> floats on the surface of a thin layer of the fluid of
        thickness <m>h</m>. The block is pushed with a force <m>F</m> parallel to the surface of the fluid,
        causing it to move with a steady velocity <m>U</m>. The shear viscosity is given by
        <me>
          \mu = \frac{F h}{A U}.
        </me>
        In principle this formula could be used to determine the viscosity of a fluid
        experimentally; however, in practice it is more common to use a falling ball viscometer (see
        <xref ref="ps-falling-ball-viscometer"/> in the worksheet at the end of this chapter).

        Many real fluids, <em>e.g.</em> blood, have more complicated viscosity
        properties, but in this course we mainly consider circumstances in which it
        is appropriate to assume that the fluid in question has a
        constant and uniform viscosity.

    <title>Reynolds number</title>
    <p>
        This is one of the most important flow parameters, and it often determines
        the qualitative nature of the flow. It is a dimensionless quantity, defined by
    </p>
    <me>
        \mathrm{Re} = \frac{\rho U L}{\mu} = \frac{U L}{\nu}
    </me>
    <p>
        where <m>U</m> is a characteristic (or typical) velocity of the flow
        and <m>L</m> is a characteristic lengthscale. It characterises the
        relative importance of viscous and inertial accelerations.
    </p>

    <paragraph>
        <title>How do we choose <m>L</m> and <m>U</m>?</title>
        <p>
            There are usually ‘natural’ scales in the problem that we can choose
            for <m>L</m> and <m>U</m>, and determining these in a given problem
            usually becomes easier with experience. As an illustrative example of a
            suitable scale choice, consider steady flow down a pipe with a circular
            cross-section. An appropriate value of <m>L</m> is often the pipe radius
            or diameter, while an appropriate value of <m>U</m> could be the velocity
            on the centreline of the pipe.

        <title>Turbulent flow</title>
        <p>
            Turbulent flow is characterised as having many different length scales,
            and the flow is <em>chaotic</em>
            <fn>Chaotic flow means that fluid particles that start close together can become widely separated over time.</fn>.
            As well as the scale of the whole experiment (e.g. the length of the cyclist
            in the example above), the turbulence has eddies on all small length scales.
            Turbulent flows are analysed mathematically by decomposing the flow into a
            mean flow, which describes the large-scale flow and a fluctuating flow,
            which describes the eddies. Equations can be written for each of these,
            but this decomposition leads to the so-called <em>closure problem</em>,
            in which an assumption needs to be made to provide a final equation that
            governs the dynamics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Turbulence is of great importance in applications such as aeronautical
            engineering, weather forecasting and large-scale industrial flows,
            basically because large and fast moving flows have such a high Reynolds
            number that turbulence is unavoidable and dominates the flow
            characteristics. Turbulence is less prevalent in many bioengineering
            applications, because they are usually on a smaller scale and involve
            slower flows.
        </p>
        <p>
            The study of turbulence could constitute a lecture course in its own right,
            and therefore a detailed analysis is beyond the scope of this course.
            However, some of the material in this course is relevant to turbulent flows.

            is described in <xref ref="sect:linmtmcons"/> on
            <pageref ref="page:vonkarmanlayer"/> is one that was famously first developed
            to analyse turbulent flows.-->

<title>Falling ball viscometer</title>
<statement>
<p>
For slowly moving spheres, the resistive force is given by Stokes
drag, and equals <m>3\pi\mu Du</m>, where <m>D</m> is the diameter of the sphere, <m>\mu</m>
is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, and <m>u</m> is the speed of the sphere
(this is a famous result).
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Check the dimensions of the Stokes drag. Is the dimension what you expect?
</p>
<answer>
<p>
The dimensions of the terms are as follows:
<me>
[3\pi]=1,\quad
[\mu]=ML^{-1}T^{-1},\quad
[D]=L,\quad
[u]=LT^{-1},
</me>
meaning that
<me>
\left[3\pi\mu Du\right]=1\times ML^{-1}T^{-1}\times L\times LT^{-1}
=MLT^{-2}.
</me>
Thus the expression <m>3\pi\mu Du</m> for the Stokes drag has the dimensions of force, as expected.

<p>
Write down a differential equation for the time-evolution of the velocity
<m>u</m> of the ballbearing, assuming that the acceleration due to gravity is <m>g</m>.
</p>
<answer>
<p>
Newton's second law gives
<me>
m\frac{du}{dt}=mg-3\pi\mu Du.
</me>
</p>
</answer>

<li>
<p>
Given that the ballbearing is released from rest, solve the differential
equation to show that
<me>
u=u_t\left(1-e^{-t/\tau}\right),
</me>
where <m>u_t</m> and <m>\tau</m> are constant parameters that you should define.
What is the physical significance of <m>u_t</m> and <m>\tau</m>?
</p>
<answer>
<p>
We have
<me>
\frac{du}{dt}+\frac{3\pi\mu D}{m}u=g,
</me>
for which the integrating factor is <m>e^{\frac{3\pi\mu D}{m}t}</m>, and
<me>
ue^{\frac{3\pi\mu D}{m}t}=\int ge^{\frac{3\pi\mu D}{m}t}dt
=\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}e^{\frac{3\pi\mu D}{m}t}+c,
</me>
where <m>c</m> is a constant of integration. Hence
<me>
u=\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}+ce^{-\frac{3\pi\mu D}{m}t}
</me>
The initial condition is <m>u=0</m> at <m>t=0</m>, and, substituting this into the above equation,
<m>0=\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}+c</m>, giving <m>c=-\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}</m>. Hence
<me>
u=\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}\left(1-e^{-\frac{3\pi\mu D}{m}t}\right).
</me>
We substitute <m>u_t=\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}</m> and <m>\tau=\frac{m}{3\pi\mu D}</m>. With these substitutions we get
<me>
u=u_t\left(1-e^{-t/\tau}\right).
</me>
The physical significance of these choices is that <m>u_t</m> is the terminal velocity of the sphere and <m>\tau</m> is the timescale over which the velocity of the sphere approaches the terminal velocity. Every <m>\tau</m> units of time, the velocity of the sphere becomes closer to the terminal velocity <m>u_t</m> by a factor <m>e\approx2.7</m>.

If the ballbearing has diameter 2 mm and is falling through glycerol at 20<m>^\circ</m>C, what is its terminal velocity in mm/s and what is the timescale taken to reach the terminal velocity? You may assume that the dynamics viscosity of glycerol at 20<m>^\circ</m>C is 1.2 Pa s and the density of steel is 8,000 kg/m<m>^3</m>.
</p>
<answer>
<p>
Using the fact that the volume of a sphere is <m>\pi D^3/6</m>, where <m>D</m> is the diameter,
we have <m>m=\pi\rho_sD^3/6</m>, where <m>\rho_s=8,000</m> kg/m<m>^3</m>. Thus
<md>
<mrow>u_t=\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}=\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}=\frac{\rho_sgD^2}{18\mu}</mrow>
<mrow>=\frac{8000\times9.81\times(4\times10^{-6})}{18\times1.2}
=0.0146\,\mbox{m/s}=14.6\,\mbox{mm/s}.</mrow>
</md>
The timescale <m>\tau</m> is given by
<me>
\tau=\frac{m}{3\pi\mu D}=\frac{\rho_sD^2}{18\mu}=\frac{8000\times4\times10^{-6}}{18\times1.2}
=0.00148\,\mbox{s}.

Comment on the experimental set up needed to measure the terminal velocity.
</p>
<answer>
<p>
The ball would attain its terminal velocity very quickly (in much less than a second),
and since <m>u_t</m> is on order of centimetres per second, a container of about 10 cm
deep would be suitable for measurement. In fact this idea is commonly used to measure
the viscosity of fluids (since the viscosity can be calculated from the terminal velocity);
this is called a <em>falling ball viscometer</em>.
