  <title>Viscous flows</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In this chapter we introduce the effects of viscosity into our fluid model. This
      leads to the famous Navier--Stokes equations, which are the governing equations for
      many fluid flows of practical interest. The viscosity has a profound
      effect on the flow, and it can lead to the formation of boundary layers and the generation
      of vorticity at solid boundaries.
