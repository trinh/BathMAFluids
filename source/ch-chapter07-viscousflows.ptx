  <title>Viscous flows</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      So far in this course, you have been considering <em>inviscid flows</em>,
      that is flows in which the fluid <em>viscosity</em> is not important.
      In this chapter we introduce the effect of <em>viscosity</em> into the dynamics.
      Fluid <em>viscosity</em> is a friction effect internal to the fluid, and it arises
      due to layers of fluid sliding over each other during fluid motion.
      Including viscosity in our fluid model will lead to the famous Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations,
      which are the governing equations for many fluid flows of practical interest.
      In many real life applications, the effect of viscosity completely changes
      the nature of the fluid flow from that which would be observed with an inviscid fluid,
      and this effect can be confined to a region of the fluid or can be throughout the entire flow.

      Flows that can be described as inviscid include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            free surface flows, such as water waves in the ocean,
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            aerodynamic flow, such as flow past an aircraft wing or a car body at high speed.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Even in some of these flows, the effect of viscosity is important, for example in the flow past an
      aerodynamic body there is a thin layer of fluid close to the body surface,
      called a <em>boundary layer</em>, in which viscous effects are important. Flows that are completely
      dominated by viscosity are called <em>viscous flows</em>, and these tend to include flows that are
      on a small spatial scale, have a low velocity scale, or are of a particularly viscous fluid, for example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Many flows in internal physiology, for example the flow of blood through blood vessels,
            especially capillaries (the smallest vessels), the flow of mucus in the respiratory system,
            fluid flows within tissues, the flow of synovial fluid in joints.
            These are often on a small spatial scale and have a low velocity scale.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Several manufacturing processes, for example paint, adhesives or food products,
            since the spatial scales involved are not large and the fluids are often quite viscous.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Other examples include lubricating flows, such as ball bearings and glacier flow.

      <title>Viscosity</title>
      <p>
        Viscosity quantifies the fluid's internal resistance to flow when a force is applied
        (the higher the resistance the higher the viscosity). One of the most common
        mathematical models of an idealised fluid is a
        <em>Newtonian</em> fluid, which will be defined precisely in <xref ref="subsec-newtonian-fluids"/>.
        For these fluids, the shear viscosity
        <m>\mu</m> (sometimes called dynamic viscosity, or just viscosity) is a scalar quantity.
        In S.I. units, it is measured in <m>\textrm{Pa\,s} = \mathrm{kg\,m^{-1}\,s^{-1}}</m>.
      </p>
      <example xml:id="example-viscosity">
        <title>Thought experiment to measure viscosity</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            We could imagine a thought experiment to measure the shear viscosity of a fluid as follows, see
            also <xref ref="fig-viscosity-measurement"/>.
            A solid block of area <m>A</m> floats on the surface of a thin layer of the fluid of
            thickness <m>h</m>. The block is pushed with a force <m>F</m> parallel to the surface of the fluid,
            causing it to move with a steady velocity <m>U</m>. The shear viscosity is given by
            <me>
              \mu = \frac{F h}{A U}.
            </me>
            In principle this formula could be used to determine the viscosity of a fluid
            experimentally; however, in practice it is more common to use a falling ball viscometer (see
            <xref ref="ps-falling-ball-viscometer"/> in the worksheet at the end of this chapter).

      <p>
        The shear viscosity of air increases with increasing temperature,
        whereas that of water decreases with increasing temperature.
        This is typical behaviour for gases and liquids, respectively.
        Many real fluids have more complicated viscosity
        properties, for example blood, mucus, shampoo, egg white and custard.
        In this course we mainly consider Newtonian fluids, thereby avoiding a lot of complexity!
      </p>

      <remark>
        <p>
          Note that we have not yet formally defined the shear viscosity, although the
          example given in <xref ref="example-viscosity"/> provides an informal definition.
          This concept will be formalised in <xref ref="sec-stress"/>.

      <title>Reynolds number</title>
      <p>
        This is one of the most important flow parameters in the study of fluid dynamics,
        as its order of magnitude determines many of the qualitative features of the flow.
        In a given flow, it quantifies the relative importance of inertial and viscous effects.
      </p>
      <definition>
        <title>The Reynolds number</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            The Reynolds number is a dimensionless quantity, defined by
            <me>
              \textrm{Re} = \frac{\rho U L}{\mu} = \frac{U L}{\nu},
            </me>
            where <m>U</m> is a <em>characteristic</em> (or typical) velocity of the flow
            and <m>L</m> is a <em>characteristic</em> lengthscale. It equals the typical size
            of an inertial acceleration divided by a typical size of a viscous acceleration in the flow.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>
      <remark xml:id="example-choice-of-scales">
        <title>Choice of characteristic scales</title>
        <p>
          What do we pick as the <em>characteristic</em> length and velocity scales?
          This is something that gets easier with increasing experience.
          For a given problem there are usually ‘natural’ scales that arise within it.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an illustrative example of how we might think about choosing suitable scales,
          consider a steady flow along a pipe with a circular
          cross-section. An appropriate choice of <m>L</m> could be the pipe radius
          or diameter, while an appropriate value of <m>U</m> could be the velocity
          along the centreline (axis) of the pipe or the average velocity across
          the pipe cross-section (equal to the volumetric flux (volume per unit time)
          of fluid passing along the pipe divided by the cross-sectional area of the pipe).
        </p>
        <p>
          Different choices of scales
          (for example radius vs. diameter and centreline vs. average velocity
          in the pipe example given in <xref ref="example-choice-of-scales"/>)
          would lead to different numerical values of <m>\textrm{Re}</m>. However, note:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                The order of magnitude of the Reynolds number is the same for all choices.
                Thus, when describing a flow, the value of <m>\textrm{Re}</m> is often
                quoted as an order-of-magnitude property.

                If we give detailed information about exactly which
                length and velocity scales are being used then
                we can directly compare different values of <m>\textrm{Re}</m>,
                even if they are of the same order of magnitude.
                For example, we might do this in a plot of a property
                of the flow against the Reynolds number. In this case,
                it would be good scientific practice to specify the
                choice of velocity and length scales used.

        <title>Flow characteristics at different Reynolds numbers</title>
        <p>
          Typical characteristics of the flow are strongly associated with the order of magnitude
          of the Reynolds number:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><em>Low-Reynolds-number flows (<m>Re \ll 1</m>):</em>
                <ul>
                  <li>Examples include several biological examples, such as flow in capillaries
                    (the smallest blood vessels) swimming bacteria or other single cell organisms,
                    lymphatic system flow, and other examples include microfluidics,
                    glacier flow, and spreading honey on toast.</li>
                  <li>These flows are called Stokes flows (after G. G. Stokes who studied them) or creeping flows.</li>
                  <li>Low-Reynolds-number flows are also reversible, meaning that if a force is applied,
                    followed by the reverse of that force then the fluid particles return to their original positions.

      <remark>
        <title>Turbulent flow</title>
        <p>
          This is a qualitative type of flow that is characterised as having many
          different length scales, and the flow is mathematically <em>chaotic</em>.
          Chaotic flow means that fluid particles that start close together can become
          widely separated over time. As well as the scale of the whole experiment,
          the turbulence has eddies on all small length scales.
          Turbulent flows are analysed mathematically by decomposing the fluid velocity into a
          <em>mean flow</em>, which describes the large-scale flow and a <em>fluctuating flow</em>,
          which describes the eddies. Equations can be written for each of these,
          but this decomposition leads to the so-called <em>closure problem</em>,
          in which an assumption needs to be made to provide a final equation that
          governs the dynamics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turbulence is of great importance in applications such as aeronautical
          engineering, weather forecasting and large-scale industrial flows,
          basically because large and fast moving flows have a sufficiently high Reynolds
          number that turbulence is unavoidable and it dominates the flow
          characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>
          The study of turbulence could constitute a lecture course in its own right,
          and therefore a detailed analysis is beyond the scope of this course.

      <title>State relations</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          In addition to the balances implied by mass and momentum conservation that
          you have so far been working on in this course, there is an additional condition needed,
          and this is called
          a <em>state relation</em>. This relates the thermodynamic variables density <m>\rho</m>,
          pressure <m>p</m> and temperature <m>T</m>. In this section, we give two of the most
          common state relations that are used mathematically,
          the first for liquids and the second for gases.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <subsubsection>
        <title>Liquids</title>
        <p>
          Liquids are often assumed to be incompressible, that is we assume
          <m>\rho = \textrm{constant}</m>.
          This is the most common assumption made in this course. However, it is important
          to be aware that it is not always appropriate.
        </p>
        <remark>
          <p>
            One of the most common reasons that making the assumption <m>\rho = \textrm{constant}</m>
            does not capture the flow dynamics accurately is if there are significant
            temperature variations within the liquid.
            Typically, liquids expand as the temperature rises, and this leads to <em>thermal convection</em>,
            which needs to be taken into account in the mathematical analysis.

            <em>Proof that this is equivalent to <xref ref="eqn-idealgas"/>.</em>

          <p>In fluid dynamics the form <xref ref="eqn-idealgas"/> is more convenient than <m>pV=nRT</m>

            <em>no-slip condition</em>. When solving problems in fluid
            mechanics we usually apply these relationships to provide boundary conditions.

          Note that this condition is weaker than the corresponding one for viscous fluids,
          since it only applies to one component of the velocity.
          As we will shortly see, the extra conditions for viscous fluids are mathematically necessary,
          since the equation for conservation of momentum for viscous fluids has spatial derivatives
          of higher order.

      <title>Force balance at the boundary/interface</title>
      <p>
        In addition to the boundary conditions on the velocity given in
        <xref ref="boundary-conditions-velocity"/>, we sometimes need to apply a <em>force balance</em>
        condition at the boundary of the fluid or at the interface between two fluids in a
        free boundary problem.
      </p>
      <remark><title>Rigid boundaries</title>
        <p>
          Thankfully, in the case of a fluid<ndash/>solid boundary, if the solid is rigid
          (which we often assume), the no-slip
          boundary conditions on the velocity are sufficient to solve the problem mathematically.
          If desired, a force balance can be performed after solving the problem, and this determines
          the <em>stress</em> (force per unit area) that the fluid exerts on the solid wall, and we
          can thus find the <em>reaction force</em> that the wall applies in order to maintain
          its position in the presence of the flowing fluid.          
        </p>
      </remark>
      <p>
        However, if the solid <em>moves in response to the fluid</em>, either because it is an elastic solid
        or because the solid is not <em>tethered</em>,
        then a force balance is required to solve the problem mathematically. This is
        called a <em>fluid<ndash/>structure interaction problem</em>,
        and these are typically very difficult to solve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, at a fluid<ndash/>fluid interface, a force balance is typically
        required to solve the problem. The difference between the stresses of the two
        fluids on the interface (the forces each fluid exerts on the interface per unit
        area of the interface) is balanced by the <em>surface tension</em> that arises
        within the interface.

      <title>Surface tension</title>
      <p>
        The interface between two immiscible fluids (e.g. air and water, or water and mercury) creates
        surface tension, a force per unit length.
        This is of considerable importance in many fluid mechanics problems,
        especially those involving small lengthscales.

            The fluid stress on a surface, <m>\btau</m>, is the force per unit area exerted

            It is often convenient to decompose the stress into two contributions, as these are

        <title>Defining the fluid pressure in terms of the stress tensor</title>
        <p>
          We can now write a mathematical definition of the fluid pressure in terms
          of the stress tensor:
          <men xml:id="eq-defofp">
            p=-\frac13\textrm{tr}\left(\bsigma\right)=-\frac13\textrm{tr}\left(\bsigma\right).
          </men>
          This equation gives us a method by which we can (at least in our imagination)
          think about measuring the pressure at a particular point in the fluid.
          We consider three small, mutually orthogonal planes passing through the point
          (aligned perpendicular to the <m>x</m>-, <m>y</m>- and <m>z</m>-directions)
          and measure the three forces on the three surfaces.
          Dividing each force by the area of the respective plane leads to the stresses on the surfaces,
          which are, respectively,
          <me>
            \left(\begin{matrix}\sigma_{11}\\\sigma_{21}\\\sigma_{31}\end{matrix}\right),\quad
            \left(\begin{matrix}\sigma_{12}\\\sigma_{22}\\\sigma_{32}\end{matrix}\right),
            \quad\textrm{and}\quad
            \left(\begin{matrix}\sigma_{13}\\\sigma_{23}\\\sigma_{33}\end{matrix}\right).
          </me>
          The normal components of the respective stresses are
          <m>\sigma_{11}</m>, <m>\sigma_{22}</m> and <m>\sigma_{33}</m>,
          and hence the pressure is the average of the three normal components of the stresses.
          The interpretation of the pressure is different for compressible and incompressible fluids:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <em>Compressible fluids:</em>
                From classical thermodynamics it is known that we can define the pressure
                of the fluid as a parameter of state, making use of an equation of state
                (for example <m>p=\rho RT</m> for an ideal gas).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <em>Incompressible fluids:</em>
                For an incompressible fluid the pressure <m>p</m> is an independent,
                purely dynamical, variable.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          In this course we mainly consider incompressible fluids.

          is a multiple of the identity matrix and the only stresses are due to the pressure.

        <title>The constitutive relationship of a fluid</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            This is an equation that describes the relationship between the stress tensor
            and the kinematic state of the fluid. It is found from experiments,
            and governs the mechanical behaviour of the fluid, that is the <em>rheology</em> of the fluid.
            Together with the equations of mass and momentum conservation,
            this closes the problem for the velocity and pressure fields.
            Every fluid obeying the continuum approximation has a constitutive relationship,
            which can be thought of as a definition of its mechanical properties.

            Newton was also responsible for the laws of motion and universal gravitation,

        <title>Derivation of Newtonian fluid stress tensor from first principles</title>
        <p><em>Non-examinable:</em></p>
        <p>
          Newtonian fluids have the following properties:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                The deviatoric part of the stress tensor, <m>\bd</m>, is a linear function
                of the nine velocity gradients,
                <me>(\nabla\bu)_{ij}=\pd{u_j}{x_i}.</me>
                This implies
                <me>d_{ij}=\sum_{l=1}^3\sum_{k=1}^3c_{ijkl}\pd{u_l}{x_k}</me>
                for some unknown scalars <m>c_{ijkl}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The fluid is homogeneous, i.e. <m>\bsigma</m> does not depend explicitly on
                <m>\bx</m>. This implies that the <m>c_{ijkl}</m>'s are constant in space.
                An example of when this would not be the case would be an inhomogeneous fluid,
                such as a fluid that is heated differentially.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The fluid is isotropic, i.e. there is no preferred direction.
                Insisting that <m>\bd</m> transforms correctly under rotations
                (and in fact we only need to consider rotations through <m>90^\circ</m>
                about the coordinate axes) implies that <m>c_{ijkl}</m> is zero unless
                each subscript appears an even number of times. That is, the only non-zero terms
                are <m>c_{1111}</m>, <m>c_{2222}</m>, <m>c_{3333}</m> (which must all be equal),
                and those <m>c_{ijkl}</m>'s in which two of the indices
                <m>i</m>, <m>j</m>, <m>k</m>, <m>l</m>
                are '1' and two indices are '2', also terms with two `2's and two `3's,
                and terms with two `1's and two `3's (and these obey certain equalities too).
                An example of when this would not be the case would be an anisotropic fluid,
                such as nematic liquid crystals (long chain molecules that align in a magnetic field)
                or flowing blood in which the red blood cells align in the direction of flow).
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          Additionally requiring that <m>\bd</m> is a symmetric matrix means that,
          in component form, we can reduce the <m>c_{ijkl}</m>'s down to just two
          independent scalar parameters, <m>\lambda</m> and <m>\mu</m>, and we have
          <men xml:id="eq-Newtonianstress">
            \sigma_{ij}=-p\delta_{ij}+\lambda\delta_{ij}\sum_{k=1}^3\pd{u_k}{x_k}

          </men>
          where <m>\lambda</m> is the <em>bulk viscosity</em> of the fluid and <m>\mu</m>
          is the <em>dynamic shear viscosity</em>. In vector form
          <me>
            \bsigma=-p\bI+\lambda\left(\nabla\cdot\bu\right)\bI+2\mu\be,
          </me>
          where <m>\be</m> is the rate-of-strain tensor, given by
          <me>\be=\left(\begin{matrix}
            e_{11}&amp;e_{12}&amp;e_{13}\\
            e_{21}&amp;e_{22}&amp;e_{23}\\

            \end{matrix}\right).
          </me>
          If the fluid is incompressible, then <m>\nabla\cdot\bu=0</m> and
          the bulk viscosity is undefined, meaning that <xref ref="eq-Newtonianstress"/>
          reduces to

                For an incompressible Newtonian fluid the stress tensor has only one parameter,
                the shear viscosity, <m>\mu</m>, and there are are only two parameters needed to
                describe the mechanical behaviour of the fluid: <m>\mu</m> and the fluid density, <m>\rho</m>.

                The shear viscosity, <m>\mu</m>, is often a function of temperature,
                and sometimes of pressure too. For most common fluids the shear viscosity
                decreases with increasing temperature.

      <title>Stress at a surface</title>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="def-stress-surface-calculation"/>, we stated formulae for the stress that a
        fluid exerts on a rigid solid boundary. We are now in a position to check the formulae given there.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <em>normal stress</em> on a surface with normal <m>\bn</m> is given by
        <men xml:id="eq-normalstress">
          \left(\bsigma\bn\right)\cdot\bn
          =-p+2\mu\bn\cdot\nabla\left(\bu\cdot\bn\right).
        </men>
        The last term represents <m>2\mu</m> times the derivative of the normal
        component of the velocity in the normal direction.
        Thus the normal stress is not necessary equal to the pressure!
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if we assume that the surface is <em>fixed</em> then we may show that
        the normal stress of an incompressible
        Newtonian fluid does equal the pressure:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              By rotating the coordinate axes we may assume that <m>\bn=\bi</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              From <xref ref="eq-normalstress"/>, the normal stress is <m>-p+2\mu\partial u/\partial x</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Since the fluid is incompressible,
              <me>
                \nabla\cdot\bu=\pd{u}{x}+\pd{v}{y}+\pd{w}{z}=0.
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The boundary conditions at the solid surface are <m>u=v=w=0</m>.
              Thus <me>\pd{v}{y}=\pd{w}{z}=0</me> on the surface.
              The continuity equation implies that <me>\pd{u}{x}=0</me> also.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Hence the normal stress on the surface is <m>-p</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        At a fixed solid surface the shear stress of a Newtonian fluid equals the viscosity
        multiplied by the derivative of the component of velocity parallel to the surface with
        respect to the perpendicular coordinate. We can show this as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              As before we may rotate the coordinate axes so that <m>\bn=\bi</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Using <xref ref="eq-cartesiannewtonianstress"/>, the stress at the surface is
              <me>\btau=\bsigma\bn
                =\left(\begin{matrix}
                -p+2\mu\pd{u}{x}\\
                \mu\left(\pd{u}{y}+\pd{v}{x}\right)\\
                \mu\left(\pd{u}{z}+\pd{w}{x}\right)
                \end{matrix}\right),
              </me>
              and the shear stresses are given by the <m>y</m>- and <m>z</m>-components:
              <me>
                \tau_y=\mu\left(\pd{u}{y}+\pd{v}{x}\right),\quad
                \tau_z=\mu\left(\pd{u}{z}+\pd{w}{x}\right).
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              No slip boundary conditions at the solid surface are <m>u=v=w=0</m>.
              Thus <me>\pd{u}{y}=\pd{u}{z}=0</me> on the surface.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Hence the shear stresses on the surface are
              <me>\tau_y=\mu\pd{v}{x}\quad\textrm{and}\quad\tau_z=\mu\pd{w}{x},</me>
              agreeing with the previous definitions.

        In previous chapters in this course,

        These are fluids with <m>\mu=0</m>.
        In this case, the constitutive law <xref ref="eq-cartesiannewtonianstress"/> becomes

      <title>Non-Newtonian fluids</title>
      <p>
        Many fluids do not obey the assumptions underlying a Newtonian fluid, meaning that their
        constitutive relationship takes a more complicated form.
        Many foods and household products, e.g. egg white, custard, shampoo, toothpaste have
        a <em>non-Newtonian</em> rheology.
        In the case of foods, this is often because the non-Newtonian properties themselves lend a texture
        that makes them taste better!
        For household products the non-Newtonian properties help us use them
        (for example a Newtonian shampoo might drain off our hair before we have a chance to work it in).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations do not work for genuinely non-Newtonian flows,
        and the pressure and viscous terms must be replaced by a formula that captures the rheology.
        However, for a surprising variety of complex fluids,
        the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations do in fact provide a remarkably good description of the behaviour.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, however, the rheology of non-Newtonian fluids is often very complex,
        and is an area of active research.
        Categories include the following:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Non-constant viscosity:</em>
              This is perhaps the simplest way a fluid can be non-Newtonian.
              Examples include shear thinning fluids, e.g. blood,
              and shear-thickening fluids, e.g. fluids containing cornflour such as custard,
              or fluids whose viscosity depends on the temperature of the fluid.

              <em>Viscoelastic fluids:</em>
              These are fluids that have both elastic and viscous properties,
              that is the molecules seem to have a memory and spring back when they are
              suddenly displaced (but not so much when they are slowly displaced);
              thus they are sometimes described as having a `fading memory'.
              In this case the formula for the deviatoric part of the stress
              tensor involves an integral over the previous states of the fluid.
              Examples include ketchup, paint, mucus and vitreous humour.

              <em>Anisotropic fluids:</em> Some fluids respond differently to the same stress
              but applied in different directions.
              An example of this is blood, which
              contains red blood cells affecting the dynamics. When the blood is flowing the cells align,
              meaning the effective viscosity is much less in the direction of flow and
              more in the transverse direction (this is also related to the fact that blood is shear thinning).
              In large arteries it is usually acceptable to model blood as a Newtonian fluid
              because the diameter of the artery is many times that of the cells.
              However, for small arteries, such as that in <xref ref="fig-artery"/>,
              the Newtonian model does not give an accurate picture.

        We consider the balance of linear momentum
        in a small cube of side length <m>\delta</m> for an <em>incompressible fluid</em>,
        see <xref ref="fig-small-cube"/>.
        To do this we employ the Reynolds Transport Theorem <xref ref="eqn-RTT"/>,
        with <m>\bf(\bx,t)</m> equal to the linear momentum of the fluid per unit volume,
        <m>\bf=\rho\bu</m>, and <m>V(t)</m> being the small volume of fluid under consideration,
        which coincides with the cube at time <m>t</m> (however, note that the volume of fluid
        we are following is not generally a cube at other times). The theorem states that:

          \dd{}{t} \iiint_{V(t)} f \, \de{x} \, \de{y} \, \de{z} = \iiint_{V(t)} \left[

        We note that <m>\iiint_{V(t)} f \, \de{x} \, \de{y} \, \de{z}</m> is the integral of the
        linear momentum per unit volume over the volume and is therefore the total momentum
        of the fluid particles in <m>V(t)</m>. The left-hand side of this equation is thus
        the Lagrangian rate of change of momentum of these fluid particles.
        By Newton's second law, this must equal the total force acting on the fluid
        in <m>V(t)</m>, which we denote by <m>\bF</m>. This force has different contributions, which
        can be categorised into <em>body forces</em> (which act on the whole volume of fluid)

        <title>Clarification on the detail of the proof</title>
        <p>
          Note that there was some sleight of hand going on in this proof!
          We assumed that the stress was uniform over each face of the cube,
          meaning we could just multiply the stress on each face by the
          area of the face to get the force on that face.
          Indeed, if this were actually the case, then the stress would be uniform
          over the whole surface of the cube, and hence the net force on the surface would be zero.
          To resolve this, we would need to add higher-order contributions into the integrand
          when calculating the force on each face, which could result in higher-order contributions
          to the resultant force due to the sum of the stresses. We could do this by writing the stress as a Taylor series about the corner of the cube.
          Happily, with a bit more work (not included here), these higher order
          terms cancel and the result we obtained here holds.

          The Navier<ndash/>Stokes equation is notoriously difficult to solve, particularly as the term
          <me>\rho\bu\cdot\nabla\bu</me> is nonlinear. In fact, one of the famous <url href="https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/">Millennium Prize Problems</url> is to prove that in three dimensions, given suitable initial and boundary conditions, there always exists a smooth solution of the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equation for all time, or to provide an example where this does not hold.  The problem is that the nonlinear term can lead to singularities developing in the solution, which would correspond to infinite velocities or pressures at some point in the fluid.  This is not expected to happen in real fluids, but proving this rigorously is a major challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          You will be relieved to know that in this course we will only consider simple solutions of the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations (often ones in which the nonlinear term equals zero).

There are four equations governing their behaviour, which are the incompressible continuity equation <xref ref="eqn-incompressibledef"/> and the three components of the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equation <xref ref="eqn-navierstokes"/>. In addition, we need to specify appropriate boundary conditions (for example, no slip conditions at a solid boundary) and initial conditions (the velocity and pressure at time <m>t=0</m>).

            Check that this flow satisfies the continuity and Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations,

            The question of whether the flow satisfies the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations
            now becomes a question of whether we can find a pressure field <m>p</m> satisfying
            each of these equations. The first equation has solution
            <me>
              p=-\frac12\rho K^2x^2+f_1(y,z),

            </md>
            where <m>f_2(z)</m> is an arbitrary function of <m>z</m>.

            Since we have found an expression for the pressure that satisfies
            all three components of the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations,
            we can say that the given flow does satisfy the equations.
          </p>
        </solution>
      </example>
      <remark>
        <p>
          Note that in general if we have an expression for <m>\nabla p</m>,
          say we know that <m>\nabla p={\bf q}</m>, then we can check whether or not
          it it is possible to find <m>p</m> by taking the curl of both sides,
          i.e. <m>\nabla\times{\bf q}=\nabla\times\nabla p=0</m>
          (since <m>\nabla\times\nabla f=0</m> for all functions <m>f</m>).
          If <m>{\bf q}</m> satisfies <m>\nabla\times{\bf q}=0</m> then
          it is possible to find a pressure field (and hence the Navier<ndash/>Stokes
          equations are satisfied), otherwise it is not.  In this example
          <me>
            \nabla p=-\rho K^2x\bi-\rho K^2y\bj
            -(4\rho K^2z+\rho g)\bk,
          </me>
          and
          <me>
            \nabla\times\left(-\rho K^2x\bi-\rho K^2y\bj
            -(4\rho K^2z+\rho g)\bk\right)=0,
          </me>
          as expected.
        </p>
      </remark>
      <remark>
        <p>
          It is quite possible for a flow not to satisfy the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations.
          For example, the similar looking flow
          <men xml:id="eq-altflow">
            \bu=K(x+y)\bi+Ky\bj-2Kz\bk,
          </men>
          does satisfy the continuity equation, but has
          <me>
            \bu\cdot\nabla\bu=K^2(x+2y)\bi+K^2y\bj+4K^2z\bk.
          </me>
          The Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations would give
          <me>
            \nabla p=-\left(-\rho K^2(x+2y),-\rho K^2y,-4\rho K^2z-\rho g\right).
          </me>
          Trying to solve this from the first equation would give
          <me>
            p=-\frac12\rho K^2(x^2+4xy)+f_1(y,z),
          </me>
          and substituting this solution into the second equation gives
          <me>
            -2\rho K^2x+\pd{f_1}{y}=-\rho K^2y\quad\Rightarrow\quad
            \pd{f_1}{y}=2\rho K^2x-\rho K^2y.
          </me>
          This is a contradiction as <m>f_1</m> is supposed to be a function of <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> only,
          but here the right-hand side depends on <m>x</m>, meaning that <m>f_1</m> has to depend on <m>x</m>.
          Alternatively we could show that the curl of <m>\nabla p</m> is non-zero,
          which also implies a contradiction.

          For slowly moving spheres, the resistive force is given by Stokes
          drag, and equals <m>3\pi\mu Du</m>, where <m>D</m> is the diameter of the sphere, <m>\mu</m>
          is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, and <m>u</m> is the speed of the sphere
          (this is a famous result).

            Check the dimensions of the Stokes drag. Is the dimension what you expect?

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The dimensions of the terms are as follows:
            <me>
              [3\pi]=1,\quad
              [\mu]=ML^{-1}T^{-1},\quad
              [D]=L,\quad
              [u]=LT^{-1},
            </me>
            meaning that
            <me>
              \left[3\pi\mu Du\right]=1\times ML^{-1}T^{-1}\times L\times LT^{-1}
              =MLT^{-2}.

            deep would be suitable for measurement. In fact this idea is commonly used to measure
            the viscosity of fluids (since the viscosity can be calculated from the terminal velocity);
            this is called a <em>falling ball viscometer</em>.

      <title>Stress on a surface due to the pressure</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          In this problem, you will calculate the resultant force on the cube shown in
          <xref ref="fig-small-cube"/> due to the pressure in the surrounding fluid acting on the fluid
          within the cube.
          We will consider two different methods of calculating this force.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that, in this question, as with the derivation of the
          Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations <xref ref="eqn-navierstokes"/>,
          you may use some sleight of hand, so as to avoid carefully integrating
          the force over the surface.
          However, as in that case, fortunately the errors cancel and the result is correct.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Assuming that the pressure <m>p(x,y,z)</m> is uniform over the surface
            <m>x=x_0</m> and over the surface <m>x=x_0+\delta</m>,
            calculate the force on the fluid in the cube due to the pressure of the
            surrounding fluid on these two faces and show that it is approximately
            <me>-\delta^3\pd{p}{x}\bi=-V\pd{p}{x}\bi,</me>
            where <m>V=\delta^3</m> is the volume of the cube.

        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The force on <m>x=x_0</m> is pressure times area acting into the cube,
            which is <m>\delta^2p|_{x_0}\bi</m>, while the force on <m>x=x_0+\delta</m>
            equals <m>-\delta^2p|_{x+\delta}\bi</m>.
            Hence the contribution to the force from these two faces is

            Similarly, calculate the force on the fluid in the cube due to the pressure of the
            surrounding fluid on the faces <m>y=y_0</m> and <m>y=y_0+\delta</m>,
            and on the faces <m>z=z_0</m> and <m>z=z_0+\delta</m>.
            Hence show that the total force on the fluid in the cube due to the pressure
            of the surrounding fluid is given by

          <p>
            The force on <m>y=y_0</m> is <m>\delta^2p|_{y_0}\bj</m> and that on <m>y=y_0+\delta</m>
            is <m>-\delta^2p|_{y+\delta}\bj</m>. This gives a contribution

              \approx-\delta^3\pd{p}{y}\bj=-V\pd{p}{y}\bj.

            Similarly,
            the force on <m>z=z_0</m> is <m>\delta^2p|_{z_0}\bk</m> and that on <m>z=z_0+\delta</m>
            is <m>-\delta^2p|_{z+\delta}\bk</m>. This gives a contribution

            The unit normal to the face <m>x=x_0</m> is <m>\hat{\bn}=-\bi</m>,

            Hence the force on this face equals <m>\delta^2p_{x=x_0}\bi</m>.
            Similarly, the unit normal to the face <m>x=x_0+\delta</m> is <m>\hat{\bn}=\bi</m>,

            The contributions from the other faces can be calculated similarly,

            </md>
            We now make use of the vector calculus identities given in the hint.
            The first term becoems
            <me>
              \iint_S-p\hat{\bn}\de S=\iiint_V-\nabla p\de V,
            </me>
            the second term becomes
            <me>
              \iint_S2\mu(\hat{\bn}\cdot\nabla)\bu\de S
              =\iiint_V2\mu\nabla^2\bu\de V,
            </me>
            and for the third term,
            <md>
              <mrow>
                \iint_S\mu\hat{\bn}\times(\nabla\times\bu)\de S
                =&amp;-\iint_S\mu(\nabla\times\bu)\times\hat{\bn}\de S

              <mrow>
                =&amp;\iiint_V\mu\nabla\times(\nabla\times\bu)\de V,

              <mrow>
                =&amp;\iiint_V\mu\nabla(\nabla\cdot\bu)-\mu\nabla^2\bu\de V.
              </mrow>
            </md>
            Hence, since the fluid is incompressible and <m>\nabla\cdot\bu=0</m>,
            the third term becomes
            <me>
              \\\int_V-\mu\nabla^2\bu\de V.
            </me>
            Combining these three results gives
            <md>
              <mrow>
                \bF=&amp;\iiint_V\left(-\nabla p+2\mu\nabla^2\bu-\mu\nabla^2\bu\right)\de V

              <mrow>
                =&amp;\iiint_V\left(-\nabla p+\mu\nabla^2\bu\right)\de V,

            as required.

      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Deduce that, if the blob is small, the net force on it per unit volume of fluid
            equals <m>-\nabla p+\mu\nabla^2\bu</m>.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            If the blob is small, then the integrand in the expression for the force
            varies little over the volume of the blob, and so
            <me>
              \bF\approx\left(-\nabla p+\mu\nabla^2\bu\right)V,
            </me>
            where <m>V</m> is the volume of the blob. Hence the force per unit volume
            is given by
            <me>
              \frac{\bF}{V}=-\nabla p+\mu\nabla^2\bu,
            </me>
            as required.
