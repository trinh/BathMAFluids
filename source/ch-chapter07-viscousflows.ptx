  <title>Viscous flows</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      So far in this course, you have been considering <em>inviscid flows</em>,
      that is flows in which the fluid <em>viscosity</em> is not important.
      In this chapter we introduce the effect of <em>viscosity</em> into the dynamics.
      Fluid <em>viscosity</em> is a friction effect internal to the fluid, and it arises
      due to layers of fluid sliding over each other during fluid motion.
      Including viscosity in our fluid model will lead to the famous Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations,
      which are the governing equations for many fluid flows of practical interest.
      In many real life applications, the effect of viscosity completely changes
      the nature of the fluid flow from that which would be observed with an inviscid fluid,
      and this effect can be confined to a region of the fluid or can be throughout the entire flow.

    <p>
    Flows that can be described as inviscid include:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          free surface flows, such as water waves in the ocean,
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          aerodynamic flow, such as flow past an aircraft wing or a car body at high speed.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    Even in some of these flows, the effect of viscosity is important, for example in the flow past an
    aerodynamic body there is a thin layer of fluid close to the body surface,
    called a <em>boundary layer</em>, in which viscous effects are important. Flows that are completely
    dominated by viscosity are called <em>viscous flows</em>, and these tend to include flows that are
    on a small spatial scale, have a low velocity scale, or are of a particularly viscous fluid, for example:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Many flows in internal physiology, for example the flow of blood through blood vessels,
          especially capillaries (the smallest vessels), the flow of mucus in the respiratory system,
          fluid flows within tissues, the flow of synovial fluid in joints.
          These are often on a small spatial scale and have a low velocity scale.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Several manufacturing processes, for example paint, adhesives or food products,
          since the spatial scales involved are not large and the fluids are often quite viscous.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Other examples include lubricating flows, such as ball bearings and glacier flow.

    <title>Viscosity</title>
    <p>
        Viscosity quantifies the fluid's internal resistance to flow when a force is applied
        (the higher the resistance the higher the viscosity). One of the most common
        mathematical models of an idealised fluid is a
        <em>Newtonian</em> fluid, which will be defined precisely in <xref ref="subsec-newtonian-fluids"/>.
        For these fluids, the shear viscosity
        <m>\mu</m> (sometimes called dynamic viscosity, or just viscosity) is a scalar quantity.
        In S.I. units, it is measured in <m>\textrm{Pa\,s} = \mathrm{kg\,m^{-1}\,s^{-1}}</m>.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example-viscosity">
      <p>
        We could imagine a thought experiment to measure the shear viscosity of a fluid as follows, see
        also <xref ref="fig-viscosity-measurement"/>.       
        <figure xml:id="fig-viscosity-measurement">

      </figure>
        A solid block of area <m>A</m> floats on the surface of a thin layer of the fluid of
        thickness <m>h</m>. The block is pushed with a force <m>F</m> parallel to the surface of the fluid,
        causing it to move with a steady velocity <m>U</m>. The shear viscosity is given by
        <me>
          \mu = \frac{F h}{A U}.
        </me>
        In principle this formula could be used to determine the viscosity of a fluid
        experimentally; however, in practice it is more common to use a falling ball viscometer (see
        <xref ref="ps-falling-ball-viscometer"/> in the worksheet at the end of this chapter).

        the kinematic viscosity <m>\nu</m> (measured in

    <p>
    The shear viscosity of air increases with increasing temperature,
    whereas that of water decreases with increasing temperature.
    This is typical behaviour for gases and liquids, respectively.
    Many real fluids have more complicated viscosity
    properties, for example blood, mucus, shampoo, egg white and custard.
    In this course we mainly consider Newtonian fluids, thereby avoiding a lot of complexity!

      <remark>
        <p>
          Note that we have not yet formally defined the shear viscosity, although the
          example given in <xref ref="example-viscosity"/> provides an informal definition.
          This concept will be formalised in <xref ref="sec-stress"/>.

<subsection xml:id="reynolds-number">
    <title>Reynolds number</title>
    <p>
        This is one of the most important flow parameters in the study of fluid dynamics,
        as its order of magnitude determines many of the qualitative features of the flow.
        In a given flow, it quantifies the relative importance of inertial and viscous effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      <definition>
        <title>The Reynolds number</title>
           <p>
        The Reynolds number is a dimensionless quantity, defined by
    <me>
        \textrm{Re} = \frac{\rho U L}{\mu} = \frac{U L}{\nu},
    </me>
        where <m>U</m> is a <em>characteristic</em> (or typical) velocity of the flow
        and <m>L</m> is a <em>characteristic</em> lengthscale. It equals the typical size
        of an inertial acceleration divided by a typical size of a viscous acceleration in the flow.

            <title>Choice of characteristic scales</title>
            <p>
            What do we pick as the <em>characteristic</em> length and velocity scales?
            This is something that gets easier with increasing experience.
            For a given problem there are usually ‘natural’ scales that arise within it.
            </p>
            <p>
              <example xml:id="example-choice-of-scales">
                <title>Illustrative example of choice of scales</title>
                <p>
                  As an illustrative example of how we might think about choosing suitable scales,
                  consider a steady flow along a pipe with a circular
            cross-section. An appropriate choice of <m>L</m> could be the pipe radius
            or diameter, while an appropriate value of <m>U</m> could be the velocity
            along the centreline (axis) of the pipe or the average velocity across
            the pipe cross-section (equal to the volumetric flux (volume per unit time)
            of fluid passing along the pipe divided by the cross-sectional area of the pipe).
                </p>
              </example>
            </p>
                <p>
            Different choices of scales (radius vs. diameter and of centreline vs. average velocity
            in <xref ref="example-choice-of-scales"/>)
            would lead to different numerical values of <m>\textrm{Re}</m>. However, note:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The order of magnitude of the Reynolds number is the same for all choices.
                  Thus, when describing a flow, the value of <m>\textrm{Re}</m> is often
                  quoted as an order-of-magnitude property.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                    If we give detailed information about exactly which
                    length and velocity scales are being used then
                    we can directly compare different values of <m>\textrm{Re}</m>,
                    even if they are of the same order of magnitude.
                    For example, we might do this in a plot of a property
                    of the flow against the Reynolds number. In this case,
                    it would be good scientific practice to specify the
                    choice of velocity and length scales used.

            <title>Flow characteristics at different Reynolds numbers</title>
            <p>
          Typical characteristics of the flow are strongly associated with the order of magnitude
          of the Reynolds number:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><em>Low-Reynolds-number flows (<m>Re \ll 1</m>):</em>
                <ul>
                    <li>Examples include several biological examples, such as flow in capillaries
                      (the smallest blood vessels) swimming bacteria or other single cell organisms,
                      lymphatic system flow, and other examples include microfluidics,
                      glacier flow, and spreading honey on toast.</li>
                    <li>These flows are called Stokes flows (after G. G. Stokes who studied them) or creeping flows.</li>
                    <li>Low-Reynolds-number flows are also reversible, meaning that if a force is applied,
                      followed by the reverse of that force then the fluid particles return to their original positions.

                      is not <em>turbulent</em>).</li>

        <title>Turbulent flow</title>
        <p>
          This is a qualitative type of flow that is characterised as having many
          different length scales, and the flow is mathematically <em>chaotic</em>.
            Chaotic flow means that fluid particles that start close together can become
            widely separated over time. As well as the scale of the whole experiment,
            the turbulence has eddies on all small length scales.
            Turbulent flows are analysed mathematically by decomposing the fluid velocity into a
            <em>mean flow</em>, which describes the large-scale flow and a <em>fluctuating flow</em>,
            which describes the eddies. Equations can be written for each of these,
            but this decomposition leads to the so-called <em>closure problem</em>,
            in which an assumption needs to be made to provide a final equation that
            governs the dynamics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Turbulence is of great importance in applications such as aeronautical
            engineering, weather forecasting and large-scale industrial flows,
            basically because large and fast moving flows have a sufficiently high Reynolds
            number that turbulence is unavoidable and it dominates the flow
            characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>
            The study of turbulence could constitute a lecture course in its own right,
            and therefore a detailed analysis is beyond the scope of this course.
            <!--However, some of the material in this course is relevant to turbulent flows.
            For example the result by von Kármán about developing boundary layers that
            is described in <xref ref="sect:linmtmcons"/> on
            <pageref ref="page:vonkarmanlayer"/> is one that was famously first developed
            to analyse turbulent flows.-->

  <title>State relations</title>
  <p>
    In addition to the balances implied by mass and momentum conservation that
    you have so far been working on in this course, there is an additional condition needed,
    and this is called
    a <em>state relation</em>. This relates the thermodynamic variables density <m>\rho</m>,
    pressure <m>p</m> and temperature <m>T</m>. In this section, we give two of the most
    common state relations that are used mathematically, the first for liquids and the second for gases.
  </p>

  <subsubsection>
    <title>Liquids</title>
    <p>
      Liquids are often assumed to be incompressible, that is we assume
      <m>\rho = \textrm{constant}</m>.
      This is the most common assumption made in this course. However, it is important
      to be aware that it is not always appropriate.
    </p>

    <p>
    <remark>
      <p>
      One of the most common reasons that making the assumption <m>\rho = \textrm{constant}</m>
      does not capture the flow dynamics accurately is if there are significant
      temperature variations within the liquid.
      Typically, liquids expand as the temperature rises, and this leads to <em>thermal convection</em>,
      which needs to be taken into account in the mathematical analysis.

            In the buoyancy term of the momentum conservation equation
      (that is the term <m>\rho g</m> appearing in the Euler equation),
      we assume the density is a linear function of the
      temperature. Thus we write

      where <m>T_0</m> and <m>\rho_0</m>

        <li>

      In all other appearances in the governing equations, <m>\rho</m> is replaced by the constant value <m>\rho_0</m>.

      <p>In fluid dynamics the form <xref ref="eqn-idealgas"/> is more convenient than <m>pV=nRT</m>

        It is observed empirically that Newtonian viscous fluids interact with

      <me>
          \bu_{\textrm{fluid}} = \bu_{\textrm{wall}}

  <p>
    <remark>
      <p>
        In many cases, <m>\bu_{\textrm{wall}} = \boldsymbol{0}</m>, so the no-slip conditions mean

        Note that this condition is weaker than the corresponding one for viscous fluids,
        since it only applies to one component of the velocity.
        As we will shortly see, the extra conditions for viscous fluids are mathematically necessary,
        since the equation for conservation of momentum for viscous fluids has spatial derivatives
        of higher order.

    <title>Force balance at the boundary/interface</title>
    <p>
      In addition to the boundary conditions on the velocity given in
      <xref ref="boundary-conditions-velocity"/>, we sometimes need to apply a <em>force balance</em>
      condition at the boundary of the fluid or at the interface between two fluids in a
      free boundary problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      <remark><title>Rigid boundaries</title>
        <p>
        Thankfully, in the case of a fluid<ndash/>solid boundary, if the solid is rigid
        (which we often assume), the no-slip
        boundary conditions on the velocity are sufficient to solve the problem mathematically.
        If desired, a force balance can be performed after solving the problem, and this determines
        the <em>stress</em> (force per unit area) that the fluid exerts on the solid wall, and we
        can thus find the <em>reaction force</em> that the wall applies in order to maintain
        its position in the presence of the flowing fluid.          
        </p>
      </remark>
    </p>
    <p>
        However, if the solid <em>moves in response to the fluid</em>, either because it is an elastic solid
        or because the solid is not <em>tethered</em>,
        then a force balance is required to solve the problem mathematically. This is
        called a <em>fluid<ndash/>structure interaction problem</em>, and these are typically very difficult to solve.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, at a fluid<ndash/>fluid interface, a force balance is typically
        required to solve the problem. The difference between the stresses of the two
        fluids on the interface (the forces each fluid exerts on the interface per unit
        area of the interface) is balanced by the <em>surface tension</em> that arises
        within the interface.

    <title>Surface tension</title>
    <p>
      The interface between two immiscible fluids (e.g. air and water, or water and mercury) creates
      surface tension, a force per unit length.
      This is of considerable importance in many fluid mechanics problems,
      especially those involving small lengthscales.

      <p>
      The fluid stress on a surface, <m>\btau</m>, is the force per unit area exerted
      by the fluid; note that this is a vector quantity.
      It is often convenient to decompose the stress into two contributions, as these are
      often quite different both in magnitude and in physical origin:
    <ul>
      <li>Shear stress: the components tangential to the surface</li>
      <li>Normal stress: the component perpendicular to the surface.</li>
    </ul>

  <p>
    <example xml:id="example-shear-stress">
      <title>Fluid stress in arteries</title>
      <p>
      The shear stress on arterial walls is everywhere maintained
      at around <m>\sim1.5</m> Pa, whereas the normal stress is typically much larger at ~11–16 kPa.
      The distribution of shear stress, although much smaller than the normal stress,
      is known to be of great importance to our
      health as it is linked to the development of atherosclerosis, which leads to heart attacks
      and strokes, two of the leading causes of death worldwide.

      <title>Defining the fluid pressure in terms of the stress tensor</title>
            <p>
              We can now write a mathematical definition of the fluid pressure in terms
              of the stress tensor:
              <men xml:id="eq-defofp">
                p=-\frac13\textrm{tr}\left(\bsigma\right)=-\frac13\textrm{tr}\left(\bsigma\right).
              </men>
              This equation gives us a method by which we can (at least in our imagination)
              think about measuring the pressure at a particular point in the fluid.
              We consider three small, mutually orthogonal planes passing through the point
              (aligned perpendicular to the <m>x</m>-, <m>y</m>- and <m>z</m>-directions)
              and measure the three forces on the three surfaces.
              Dividing each force by the area of the respective plane leads to the stresses on the surfaces,
              which are, respectively,
              <me>
              \left(\begin{matrix}\sigma_{11}\\\sigma_{21}\\\sigma_{31}\end{matrix}\right),\quad
              \left(\begin{matrix}\sigma_{12}\\\sigma_{22}\\\sigma_{32}\end{matrix}\right),\quad\textrm{and}\quad
              \left(\begin{matrix}\sigma_{13}\\\sigma_{23}\\\sigma_{33}\end{matrix}\right).
              </me>
              The normal components of the respective stresses are
              <m>\sigma_{11}</m>, <m>\sigma_{22}</m> and <m>\sigma_{33}</m>,
              and hence the pressure is the average of the three normal components of the stresses.
              The interpretation of the pressure is different for compressible and incompressible fluids:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <em>Compressible fluids:</em>
                    From classical thermodynamics it is known that we can define the pressure
                    of the fluid as a parameter of state, making use of an equation of state
                    (for example <m>p=\rho RT</m> for an ideal gas).
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    <em>Incompressible fluids:</em>
                    For an incompressible fluid the pressure <m>p</m> is an independent,
                    purely dynamical, variable.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              In this course we mainly consider incompressible fluids.

      <title>Derivation of Newtonian fluid stress tensor from first principles</title>
      <p><em>Non-examinable:</em></p>
      <p>
          Newtonian fluids have the following properties:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                The deviatoric part of the stress tensor, <m>\bd</m>, is a linear function
                of the nine velocity gradients,
                <me>(\nabla\bu)_{ij}=\pd{u_j}{x_i}.</me>
                This implies
                <me>d_{ij}=\sum_{l=1}^3\sum_{k=1}^3c_{ijkl}\pd{u_l}{x_k}</me>
                for some unknown scalars <m>c_{ijkl}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The fluid is homogeneous, i.e. <m>\bsigma</m> does not depend explicitly on
                <m>\bx</m>. This implies that the <m>c_{ijkl}</m>'s are constant in space.
                An example of when this would not be the case would be an inhomogeneous fluid,
                such as a fluid that is heated differentially.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The fluid is isotropic, i.e. there is no preferred direction.
                Insisting that <m>\bd</m> transforms correctly under rotations
                (and in fact we only need to consider rotations through <m>90^\circ</m>
                about the coordinate axes) implies that <m>c_{ijkl}</m> is zero unless
                each subscript appears an even number of times. That is, the only non-zero terms
                are <m>c_{1111}</m>, <m>c_{2222}</m>, <m>c_{3333}</m> (which must all be equal),
                and those <m>c_{ijkl}</m>'s in which two of the indices <m>i</m>, <m>j</m>, <m>k</m>, <m>l</m>
                are '1' and two indices are '2', also terms with two `2's and two `3's,
                and terms with two `1's and two `3's (and these obey certain equalities too).
                An example of when this would not be the case would be an anisotropic fluid,
                such as nematic liquid crystals (long chain molecules that align in a magnetic field)
                or flowing blood in which the red blood cells align in the direction of flow).
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          Additionally requiring that <m>\bd</m> is a symmetric matrix means that,
          in component form, we can reduce the <m>c_{ijkl}</m>'s down to just two
          independent scalar parameters, <m>\lambda</m> and <m>\mu</m>, and we have
          <men xml:id="eq-Newtonianstress">
          \sigma_{ij}=-p\delta_{ij}+\lambda\delta_{ij}\sum_{k=1}^3\pd{u_k}{x_k}
          +\mu\left(\pd{u_j}{x_i}+\pd{u_i}{x_j}\right),
          </men>
          where <m>\lambda</m> is the <em>bulk viscosity</em> of the fluid and <m>\mu</m>
          is the <em>dynamic shear viscosity</em>. In vector form
          <me>
            \bsigma=-p\bI+\lambda\left(\nabla\cdot\bu\right)\bI+2\mu\be,
          </me>
          where <m>\be</m> is the rate-of-strain tensor, given by
          <me>\be=\left(\begin{matrix}
            e_{11}&amp;e_{12}&amp;e_{13}\\
            e_{21}&amp;e_{22}&amp;e_{23}\\
            e_{31}&amp;e_{32}&amp;e_{33}
          \end{matrix}\right).</me>
          If the fluid is incompressible, then <m>\nabla\cdot\bu=0</m> and
          the bulk viscosity is undefined, meaning that <xref ref="eq-Newtonianstress"/> reduces to

    <title>Notes on the Newtonian fluids stress tensor</title>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              For an incompressible Newtonian fluid the stress tensor has only one parameter,
              the shear viscosity, <m>\mu</m>, and there are are only two parameters needed to
              describe the mechanical behaviour of the fluid: <m>\mu</m> and the fluid density, <m>\rho</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The shear viscosity, <m>\mu</m>, is often a function of temperature,
              and sometimes of pressure too. For most common fluids the shear viscosity
              decreases with increasing temperature.

    <title>Stress at a surface</title>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="def-stress-surface-calculation"/>, we stated formulae for the stress that a
        fluid exerts on a rigid solid boundary. We are now in a position to check the formulae given there.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <em>normal stress</em> on a surface with normal <m>\bn</m> is given by
        <men xml:id="eq-normalstress">
          \left(\bsigma\bn\right)\cdot\bn
          =-p+2\mu\bn\cdot\nabla\left(\bu\cdot\bn\right).
        </men>
        The last term represents <m>2\mu</m> times the derivative of the normal
        component of the velocity in the normal direction.
        Thus the normal stress is not necessary equal to the pressure!
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if we assume that the surface is <em>fixed</em> then we may show that
        the normal stress of an incompressible
        Newtonian fluid does equal the pressure:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              By rotating the coordinate axes we may assume that <m>\bn=\bi</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              From <xref ref="eq-normalstress"/>, the normal stress is <m>-p+2\mu\partial u/\partial x</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Since the fluid is incompressible,
              <me>
                \nabla\cdot\bu=\pd{u}{x}+\pd{v}{y}+\pd{w}{z}=0.
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The boundary conditions at the solid surface are <m>u=v=w=0</m>.
              Thus <me>\pd{v}{y}=\pd{w}{z}=0</me> on the surface.
              The continuity equation implies that <me>\pd{u}{x}=0</me> also.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Hence the normal stress on the surface is <m>-p</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        At a fixed solid surface the shear stress of a Newtonian fluid equals the viscosity
        multiplied by the derivative of the component of velocity parallel to the surface with
        respect to the perpendicular coordinate. We can show this as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              As before we may rotate the coordinate axes so that <m>\bn=\bi</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Using <xref ref="eq-cartesiannewtonianstress"/>, the stress at the surface is
              <me>\btau=\bsigma\bn

    <title>Non-Newtonian fluids</title>
    <p>
      Many fluids do not obey the assumptions underlying a Newtonian fluid, meaning that their
      constitutive relationship takes a more complicated form.
      They are called <em>non-Newtonian fluids</em>, and examples include
      blood, paint, toothpaste, shampoo, custard, cornflour suspension,
      quicksand, and many others.
      The rheology of non-Newtonian fluids is often very complex,
      and is an area of active research.
      Categories of non-Newtonian fluids include the following:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
          <em>Non-constant viscosity:</em>
          This is perhaps the simplest way a fluid can be non-Newtonian.
          Examples include shear thinning fluids, e.g. blood,
          and shear-thickening fluids, e.g. fluids containing cornflour such as custard,
          or fluids whose viscosity depends on the temperature of the fluid.

            <em>Viscoelastic fluids:</em> These fluids have a memory,
            and in this case the formula for the deviatoric part of the stress
            tensor involves an integral over the previous states of the fluid.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Anisotropic fluids:</em> These are fluids that have different properties
            in different directions. A physiological example of this is blood, which
            contains red blood cells. When the blood is flowing the cells align,
            meaning the effective viscosity is much less in the direction of flow and
            more in the transverse direction.
            In large arteries it is usually acceptable to model blood as a Newtonian fluid
            because the diameter of the artery is many times that of the cells.
            However, for small arteries, such as that pictured above,
            the Newtonian model does not give an accurate picture.

\paragraph{Examples of Non-Newtonian fluids}
Many fluids are non-Newtonian in character. Examples of the ways that fluids can be non-Newtonian are:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Non-constant viscosity:} Some fluids have a different effective viscosities under different conditions. Blood and custard both have a so-called `shear-dependent' viscosity, that is the viscosity is different according to how much shear stress there is in the flow, whilst for example golden syrup has different properties at different temperatures.
\begin{itemize}
{\bf Blood:} A particular example of a non-Newtonian fluid is blood,
and the reason for its special rheology is primarily due to the presence of red blood cells.
The beautiful picture below is a numerical (computer) simulation of blood flow in a microvessel
performed by the Biological Flow Studies Laboratory in Tohoku University,
Japan (see \texttt{http://www.pfsl.mech.tohoku.ac.jp/\allowbreak contents/\allowbreak research/\allowbreak microcirculation.html}). The left picture shows the view of the blood from the outside (with the walls removed),
whilst that on the right shows the view in the central plane of the vessel.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{microcirculation1.jpg}
\end{center}
\end{itemize}

\item {\bf Viscoelastic fluids:} These are fluids that have both elastic and viscous properties, that is the molecules seem to have a memory and spring back when they are suddenly displaced (but not so much when they are slowly displaced, that is they have a `fading memory'. Examples include mucus and vitreous humour.

\item {\bf Anisotropic properties:} A few fluids respond differently to stress applied in different directions. \begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{LiquidCrystal-MesogenOrder-Nematic.jpg}
\end{center}
The picture shows a schematic representation of nematic liquid crystals, which are used in computer displays, electronic signs etc. These align by themselves to a preferred direction for high enough temperatures, and a magnetic field can be used to set the direction.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Other examples of non-Newtonian fluids:} Many foods and household products, e.g.\ egg white, custard, shampoo, have non-Newtonian rheology. In the case of foods, this is often because the non-Newtonian properties themselves lend a texture that makes them taste better! For household products the non-Newtonian properties help us use them (for example a Newtonian shampoo might drain off our hair before we have a chance to work it in).

The Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations do not work for non-Newtonian case, and the pressure and viscous terms must be replaced by a formula that captures the rheology. However, for a surprisingly large number of fluids in many circumstances, the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations do in fact provide a remarkably good description of the behaviour.

        <p>
          The stress tensor is given by
          <me>
            \bsigma=-p\bI+2\mu\be,
          </me>
          where the rate-of-strain tensor <m>\be</m> is given by

          </me>
          Hence the stress tensor <m>\bsigma</m> is given by

                For example with <m>\bn=\bj</m>, we have <m>\btau=(k\mu,-p_0)</m>.
                This makes sense as there is a background pressure <m>p_0</m> pressing into the surface
                and a stress <m>k\mu</m> arising from the shear flow and running along the surface.
                It also agrees with the formulae for stress at a surface given in

                This formula cannot be compared with the formula given in

    <title>Clarification on the detail of the proof</title>
    <p>
      Note that there was some sleight of hand going on in this proof!
      We assumed that the stress was uniform over each face of the cube,
      meaning we could just multiply the stress on each face by the
      area of the face to get the force on that face.
      Indeed, if this were actually the case, then the stress would be uniform
      over the whole surface of the cube, and hence the net force on the surface would be zero.
      To resolve this, we would need to add higher-order contributions into the integrand
      when calculating the force on each face, which could result in higher-order contributions
      to the resultant force due to the sum of the stresses. We could do this by writing the stress as a Taylor series about the corner of the cube.
      Happily, with a bit more work (not included here), these higher order
      terms cancel and the result we obtained here holds.

    <title>Solving the equations</title>
    <p>
      The Navier<ndash/>Stokes equation is notoriously difficult to solve, particularly as the term
      <me>\rho\bu\cdot\nabla\bu</me> is nonlinear. In fact, one of the famous <url href="https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/">Millennium Prize Problems</url> is to prove that in three dimensions, given suitable initial and boundary conditions, there always exists a smooth solution of the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equation for all time, or to provide an example where this does not hold.  The problem is that the nonlinear term can lead to singularities developing in the solution, which would correspond to infinite velocities or pressures at some point in the fluid.  This is not expected to happen in real fluids, but proving this rigorously is a major challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will be relieved to know that in this course we will only consider simple solutions of the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations (often ones in which the nonlinear term equals zero).

      In a typical problem, there are four unknown variables: $u$, $v$, $w$ and $p$. There are four equations governing their behaviour, which are the incompressible continuity equation <xref ref="eqn-incompressibledef"/> and the three components of the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equation <xref ref="eqn-navierstokes"/>. In addition, we need to specify appropriate boundary conditions (for example, no slip conditions at a solid boundary) and initial conditions (the velocity and pressure at time <m>t=0</m>).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Example of application of Navier<ndash/>Stokes and continuity equations}
(Based on Problem 4.34 in White).  Consider an incompressible Newtonian fluid flowing in a gravitational field ${\bf g}=-g\bk$ with velocity
\begin{equation}
\bu=Kx\bi+Ky\bj-2Kz\bk.
\end{equation}
Check that this flow satisfies the continuity and Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations, and find the pressure field.

To check the continuity equation, we consider
\begin{equation}
\nabla\cdot\bu=K+K-2K=0,
\end{equation}
so this is satisfied.

The Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations are
\begin{equation}
\rho\left(\pd{\bu}{t}
+(\bu\cdot\nabla)\bu\right)
=-\nabla p+\mu\nabla^2\bu-\rho g\bk.
\end{equation}
For the flow given
\begin{itemize}
\item $\partial\bu/\partial t=0$,
\item $\displaystyle{
\bu\cdot\nabla
=Kx\pd{}{x}+Ky\pd{}{y}-2Kz\pd{}{z}}$, which gives
\begin{equation}
(\bu\cdot\nabla)\bu
=K^2x\bi+K^2y\bj+4K^2z\bk,
\end{equation}
\item $\nabla^2\bu=0$.
\end{itemize}
So the components of the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations become
\begin{equation}\rho K^2x=-\pd{p}{x},\quad
\rho K^2y=-\pd{p}{y},\quad
4\rho K^2z=-\pd{p}{z}-\rho g.\end{equation}
The question of whether the flow satisfies the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations now becomes a question of whether we can find a pressure field $p$ satisfying each of these equations. The first equation has solution
\begin{equation*}
p=-\frac12\rho K^2x^2+f_1(y,z),
\end{equation*}
and substituting this solution into the second equation gives
\begin{align*}
&\pd{f_1}{y}=-\rho K^2y\\
\Rightarrow\quad
&f_1(y,z)=-\frac12\rho K^2y^2+f_2(z)\\
\Rightarrow\quad
&p=-\frac12\rho K^2(x^2+y^2)+f_2(z),
\end{align*}
and substituting this solution into the third equation gives
\begin{align*}
&\td{f_2}{z}=-4\rho K^2z-\rho g\\
\Rightarrow\quad
&f_2(z)=-2\rho K^2z^2-\rho gz+p_0\\
\Rightarrow\quad
&p=-\frac12\rho K^2(x^2+y^2+4z^2)-\rho gz+p_0.
\end{align*}
Since we have found an expression for the pressure that satisfies all three components of the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations, we can say that the given flow does satisfy the equations.

\paragraph{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Note that in general if we have an expression for $\nabla p$, say we know that $\nabla p={\bf q}$, then we can check whether or not it it is possible to find $p$ by taking the curl of both sides, {\it   i.e.} $\nabla\times{\bf q}=\nabla\times\nabla p=0$ (since $\nabla\times\nabla f=0$ for all functions $f$).  If ${\bf q}$ satisfies $\nabla\times{\bf q}=0$ then it is possible to find a pressure field (and hence the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations are satisfied), otherwise it is not.  In this example
\begin{equation}
\nabla p=-\rho K^2x\bi-\rho K^2y\bj
-(4\rho K^2z+\rho g)\bk,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\nabla\times\left(-\rho K^2x\bi-\rho K^2y\bj
-(4\rho K^2z+\rho g)\bk\right)=0,
\end{equation}
as expected.
\item It is quite possible for a flow not to satisfy the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations. For example the similar looking flow
\begin{equation}
\bu=K(x+y)\bi+Ky\bj-2Kz\bk,\label{eq:altflow}
\end{equation}
does satisfy the continuity equation, but has
\begin{equation}
\bu\cdot\nabla\bu=K^2(x+2y)\bi+K^2y\bj+4K^2z\bk.
\end{equation}
The Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations would give
\begin{equation}
\nabla p=-\left(-\rho K^2(x+2y),-\rho K^2y,-4\rho K^2z-\rho g\right).
\end{equation}
Trying to solve this from the first equation would give
\begin{equation*}
p=-\frac12\rho K^2(x^2+4xy)+f_1(y,z),
\end{equation*}
and substituting this solution into the second equation gives
\begin{equation*}
-2\rho K^2x+\pd{f_1}{y}=-\rho K^2y\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\pd{f_1}{y}=2\rho K^2x-\rho K^2y.
\end{equation*}
This is a contradiction as $f_1$ is supposed to be a function of $y$ and $z$ only, but here the right-hand side depends on $x$, meaning that $f_1$ has to depend on $x$. Alternatively we could show that the curl of $\nabla p$ is non-zero, which also implies a contradiction.

If the flow were given at a particular point in time by \eqref{eq:altflow}, what do you think would happen next?

For slowly moving spheres, the resistive force is given by Stokes

The dimensions of the terms are as follows:

What is the physical significance of <m>u_t</m> and <m>\tau</m>?
</p>
<answer>
<p>
We have
<me>
\frac{du}{dt}+\frac{3\pi\mu D}{m}u=g,
</me>
for which the integrating factor is <m>e^{\frac{3\pi\mu D}{m}t}</m>, and
<me>
ue^{\frac{3\pi\mu D}{m}t}=\int ge^{\frac{3\pi\mu D}{m}t}dt
=\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}e^{\frac{3\pi\mu D}{m}t}+c,
</me>
where <m>c</m> is a constant of integration. Hence
<me>
u=\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}+ce^{-\frac{3\pi\mu D}{m}t}
</me>
The initial condition is <m>u=0</m> at <m>t=0</m>, and, substituting this into the above equation,
<m>0=\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}+c</m>, giving <m>c=-\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}</m>. Hence
<me>
u=\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}\left(1-e^{-\frac{3\pi\mu D}{m}t}\right).
</me>
We substitute <m>u_t=\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}</m> and <m>\tau=\frac{m}{3\pi\mu D}</m>. With these substitutions we get
<me>
u=u_t\left(1-e^{-t/\tau}\right).
</me>
The physical significance of these choices is that <m>u_t</m> is the terminal velocity of the sphere and <m>\tau</m> is the timescale over which the velocity of the sphere approaches the terminal velocity. Every <m>\tau</m> units of time, the velocity of the sphere becomes closer to the terminal velocity <m>u_t</m> by a factor <m>e\approx2.7</m>.

You may assume that the dynamic viscosity of glycerol at 20<m>^\circ</m>C is 1.2 Pa s and the density of steel is 8,000 kg/m<m>^3</m>.
</p>
<answer>
<p>
Using the fact that the volume of a sphere is <m>\pi D^3/6</m>, where <m>D</m> is the diameter,
we have <m>m=\pi\rho_sD^3/6</m>, where <m>\rho_s=8,000</m> kg/m<m>^3</m>. Thus
<md>
<mrow>u_t=&amp;\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}=\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}=\frac{\rho_sgD^2}{18\mu}</mrow>
<mrow>=&amp;\frac{8000\times9.81\times(4\times10^{-6})}{18\times1.2}
=0.0146\,\textrm{m/s}=14.6\,\textrm{mm/s}.</mrow>
</md>
The timescale <m>\tau</m> is given by
<me>
\tau=\frac{m}{3\pi\mu D}=\frac{\rho_sD^2}{18\mu}=\frac{8000\times4\times10^{-6}}{18\times1.2}
=0.00148\,\textrm{s}.

Comment on the experimental set up needed to measure the terminal velocity.
</p>
<answer>
<p>
The ball would attain its terminal velocity very quickly (in much less than a second),
and since <m>u_t</m> is on order of centimetres per second, a container of about 10 cm
deep would be suitable for measurement. In fact this idea is commonly used to measure
the viscosity of fluids (since the viscosity can be calculated from the terminal velocity);
this is called a <em>falling ball viscometer</em>.

  <title>Stress on a surface due to the pressure</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      In this problem, you will calculate the resultant force on the cube shown in
      <xref ref="fig-small-cube"/> due to the pressure in the surrounding fluid acting on the fluid
      within the cube.
      We will consider two different methods of calculating this force.
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Assuming that the pressure <m>p(x,y,z)</m> is uniform over the surface
          <m>x=x_0</m> and over the surface <m>x=x_0+\delta</m>,
          calculate the force on the fluid in the cube due to the pressure of the
          surrounding fluid on these two faces and show that it is approximately
          <me>-\delta^3\pd{p}{x}\bi=-V\pd{p}{x}\bi,</me>
          where <m>V=\delta^3</m> is the volume of the cube.
        </p>
        <p>
          <answer>
            <p>
              The force on <m>x=x_0</m> is pressure times area acting into the cube,
              which is <m>\delta^2p|_{x_0}\bi</m>, while the force on <m>x=x_0+\delta</m>
              equals <m>-\delta^2p|_{x+\delta}\bi</m>.
              Hence the contribution to the force from these two faces is
              <me>\delta^2p|_{x_0}\bi-\delta^2p|_{x+\delta}\bi
                \approx-\delta^3\pd{p}{x}\bi=-V\pd{p}{x}\bi.</me>
            </p>
          </answer>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Similarly, calculate the force on the fluid in the cube due to the pressure of the
          surrounding fluid on the faces <m>y=y_0</m> and <m>y=y_0+\delta</m>,
          and on the faces <m>z=z_0</m> and <m>z=z_0+\delta</m>.
          Hence show that the total force on the fluid in the cube due to the pressure
          of the surrounding fluid is given by
          <me>-V\pd{p}{x}\bi-V\pd{p}{y}\bj-V\pd{p}{z}\bk=-V\nabla p.</me>
        </p>
        <p>
          <answer>
            <p>
              The force on <m>y=y_0</m> is <m>\delta^2p|_{y_0}\bj</m> and that on <m>y=y_0+\delta</m>
              is <m>-\delta^2p|_{y+\delta}\bj</m>. This gives a contribution
              <me>\delta^2p|_{y_0}\bj-\delta^2p|_{y+\delta}\bj
                \approx-\delta^3\pd{p}{y}\bj=-V\pd{p}{y}\bj.</me>
              Similarly,
              the force on <m>z=z_0</m> is <m>\delta^2p|_{z_0}\bk</m> and that on <m>z=z_0+\delta</m>
              is <m>-\delta^2p|_{z+\delta}\bk</m>. This gives a contribution
              <me>\delta^2p|_{z_0}\bk-\delta^2p|_{z+\delta}\bk
                \approx-\delta^3\pd{p}{z}\bk=-V\pd{p}{z}\bk.</me>
                Hence the total force on the fluid in the cube due to the pressure
                of the surrounding fluid is given by
                <me>-V\pd{p}{x}\bi-V\pd{p}{y}\bj-V\pd{p}{z}\bk=-V\nabla p.</me>

        <p>
          <answer>
            <p>
              The unit normal to the face <m>x=x_0</m> is <m>\hat{\bn}=-\bi</m>,
              and hence the stress at a point in this face is
              <me>\tau=\bsigma\hat{\bn}=-p\bI(-\bi)=p\bi.</me>
              Hence the force on this face equals <m>\delta^2p_{x=x_0}\bi</m>.
              Similarly, the unit normal to the face <m>x=x_0+\delta</m> is <m>\hat{\bn}=\bi</m>,
              and hence the stress at a point in this face is
              <me>\tau=\bsigma\hat{\bn}=-p\bI(\bi)=-p\bi.</me>
              Hence the force on this face equals <m>-\delta^2p_{x=x_0+\delta}\bi</m>.
              Thus the contribution to the force from these two faces is
              <me>\delta^2p|_{x_0}\bi-\delta^2p|_{x+\delta}\bi
                \approx-\delta^3\pd{p}{x}\bi=-V\pd{p}{x}\bi.</me>
              The contributions from the other faces can be calculated similarly,
              and the total force on the fluid in the cube due to the pressure
              of the surrounding fluid is given by
              <me>-V\pd{p}{x}\bi-V\pd{p}{y}\bj-V\pd{p}{z}\bk=-V\nabla p.</me>

      Note that, as with the derivation of the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations <xref ref="eqn-navierstokes"/>, there was some sleight of hand going on in this derivation,
      in that we did not carefully integrate the force over the surface. However, as in that case, fortunately the errors cancel and the result is correct.
