  <title>Viscous flows</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      So far in this course, you have been considering <em>inviscid flows</em>,
      that is flows in which the fluid <em>viscosity</em> is not important.
      In this chapter we introduce the effect of <em>viscosity</em> into the dynamics.
      Fluid <em>viscosity</em> is a friction effect internal to the fluid, and it arises
      due to layers of fluid sliding over each other during fluid motion.
      Including viscosity in our fluid model will lead to the famous Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations,
      which are the governing equations for many fluid flows of practical interest.
      In many real life applications, the effect of viscosity completely changes
      the nature of the fluid flow from that which would be observed with an inviscid fluid,
      and this effect can be confined to a region of the fluid or can be throughout the entire flow.

    <p>
    Flows that can be described as inviscid include:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          free surface flows, such as water waves in the ocean,
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          aerodynamic flow, such as flow past an aircraft wing or a car body at high speed.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    Even in some of these flows, the effect of viscosity is important, for example in the flow past an
    aerodynamic body there is a thin layer of fluid close to the body surface,
    called a <em>boundary layer</em>, in which viscous effects are important. Flows that are completely
    dominated by viscosity are called <em>viscous flows</em>, and these tend to include flows that are
    on a small spatial scale, have a low velocity scale, or are of a particularly viscous fluid, for example:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Many flows in internal physiology, for example the flow of blood through blood vessels,
          especially capillaries (the smallest vessels), the flow of mucus in the respiratory system,
          fluid flows within tissues, the flow of synovial fluid in joints.
          These are often on a small spatial scale and have a low velocity scale.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Several manufacturing processes, for example paint, adhesives or food products,
          since the spatial scales involved are not large and the fluids are often quite viscous.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Other examples include lubricating flows, such as ball bearings and glacier flow.

    <title>Viscosity</title>
    <p>
        Viscosity quantifies the fluid's internal resistance to flow when a force is applied
        (the higher the resistance the higher the viscosity). One of the most common
        mathematical models of an idealised fluid is a
        <em>Newtonian</em> fluid. For these fluids, the shear viscosity
        <m>\mu</m> (sometimes called dynamic viscosity, or just viscosity) is a scalar quantity.
    </p>
    <example xml:id="example-viscosity">
      <p>
        We could imagine a thought experiment to measure the shear viscosity of a fluid as follows, see
        also <xref ref="fig-viscosity-measurement"/>.       
        <figure xml:id="fig-viscosity-measurement">

      </figure>
        A solid block of area <m>A</m> floats on the surface of a thin layer of the fluid of
        thickness <m>h</m>. The block is pushed with a force <m>F</m> parallel to the surface of the fluid,
        causing it to move with a steady velocity <m>U</m>. The shear viscosity is given by
        <me>
          \mu = \frac{F h}{A U}.
        </me>
        In principle this formula could be used to determine the viscosity of a fluid
        experimentally; however, in practice it is more common to use a falling ball viscometer (see
        <xref ref="ps-falling-ball-viscometer"/> in the worksheet at the end of this chapter).

        Many real fluids have more complicated viscosity
        properties, for example blood, mucus, shampoo, egg white and custard.
        In this course we mainly consider Newtonian fluids, thereby avoiding a lot of complexity!

          Note that we have not yet formally defined the shear viscosity, although the
          example given in <xref ref="example-viscosity"/> provides an informal definition.

    <title>Reynolds number</title>
    <p>
        This is one of the most important flow parameters in the study of fluid dynamics,
        as its order of magnitude determines many of the qualitative features of the flow.
        In a given flow, it quantifies the relative importance of inertial and viscous effects.

    <p>
      <definition>
        <title>The Reynolds number</title>
           <p>
        The Reynolds number is a dimensionless quantity, defined by
    <me>
        \textrm{Re} = \frac{\rho U L}{\mu} = \frac{U L}{\nu},
    </me>
        where <m>U</m> is a <em>characteristic</em> (or typical) velocity of the flow
        and <m>L</m> is a <em>characteristic</em> lengthscale. It equals the typical size
        of an inertial acceleration divided by a typical size of a viscous acceleration in the flow.

            <title>Choice of characteristic scales</title>
            <p>
            What do we pick as the <em>characteristic</em> length and velocity scales?
            This is something that gets easier with increasing experience.
            For a given problem there are usually ‘natural’ scales that arise within it.
            </p>
            <p>
              <example xml:id="example-choice-of-scales">
                <title>Illustrative example of choice of scales</title>
                <p>
                  As an illustrative example of how we might think about choosing suitable scales,
                  consider a steady flow along a pipe with a circular
            cross-section. An appropriate choice of <m>L</m> could be the pipe radius
            or diameter, while an appropriate value of <m>U</m> could be the velocity
            along the centreline (axis) of the pipe or the average velocity across
            the pipe cross-section (equal to the volumetric flux (volume per unit time)
            of fluid passing along the pipe divided by the cross-sectional area of the pipe).
                </p>
              </example>
            </p>
                <p>
            Different choices of scales (radius vs. diameter and of centreline vs. average velocity
            in <xref ref="example-choice-of-scales"/>)
            would lead to different numerical values of <m>\textrm{Re}</m>. However, note:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  The order of magnitude of the Reynolds number is the same for all choices.
                  Thus, when describing a flow, the value of <m>\textrm{Re}</m> is often
                  quoted as an order-of-magnitude property.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                    If we give detailed information about exactly which
                    length and velocity scales are being used then
                    we can directly compare different values of <m>\textrm{Re}</m>,
                    even if they are of the same order of magnitude.
                    For example, we might do this in a plot of a property
                    of the flow against the Reynolds number. In this case,
                    it would be good scientific practice to specify the
                    choice of velocity and length scales used.

            <title>Flow characteristics at different Reynolds numbers</title>
            <p>
          Typical characteristics of the flow are strongly associated with the order of magnitude
          of the Reynolds number:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><em>Low-Reynolds-number flows (<m>Re \ll 1</m>):</em>
                <ul>
                    <li>Examples include several biological examples, such as flow in capillaries
                      (the smallest blood vessels) swimming bacteria or other single cell organisms,
                      lymphatic system flow, and other examples include microfluidics,
                      glacier flow, and spreading honey on toast.</li>
                    <li>These flows are called Stokes flows (after G. G. Stokes who studied them) or creeping flows.</li>
                    <li>Low-Reynolds-number flows are also reversible, meaning that if a force is applied,
                      followed by the reverse of that force then the fluid particles return to their original positions.

        <title>Turbulent flow</title>
        <p>
          This is a qualitative type of flow that is characterised as having many
          different length scales, and the flow is mathematically <em>chaotic</em>.
            Chaotic flow means that fluid particles that start close together can become
            widely separated over time. As well as the scale of the whole experiment,
            the turbulence has eddies on all small length scales.
            Turbulent flows are analysed mathematically by decomposing the fluid velocity into a
            <em>mean flow</em>, which describes the large-scale flow and a <em>fluctuating flow</em>,
            which describes the eddies. Equations can be written for each of these,
            but this decomposition leads to the so-called <em>closure problem</em>,
            in which an assumption needs to be made to provide a final equation that
            governs the dynamics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Turbulence is of great importance in applications such as aeronautical
            engineering, weather forecasting and large-scale industrial flows,
            basically because large and fast moving flows have a sufficiently high Reynolds
            number that turbulence is unavoidable and it dominates the flow
            characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>
            The study of turbulence could constitute a lecture course in its own right,
            and therefore a detailed analysis is beyond the scope of this course.
            <!--However, some of the material in this course is relevant to turbulent flows.
            For example the result by von Kármán about developing boundary layers that
            is described in <xref ref="sect:linmtmcons"/> on
            <pageref ref="page:vonkarmanlayer"/> is one that was famously first developed
            to analyse turbulent flows.-->

  <title>State relations</title>
  <p>
    In addition to the balances implied by mass and momentum conservation that
    you have so far been working on in this course, there is an additional condition needed,
    and this is called
    a <em>state relation</em>. This relates the thermodynamic variables density <m>\rho</m>,
    pressure <m>p</m> and temperature <m>T</m>. In this section, we give two of the most
    common state relations that are used mathematically, the first for liquids and the second for gases.

  <subsubsection>
    <title>Liquids</title>
    <p>
      Liquids are often assumed to be incompressible, that is we assume
      <m>\rho = \textrm{constant}</m>.
      This is the most common assumption made in this course. However, it is important
      to be aware that it is not always appropriate.
    </p>

    <p>
    <remark>
      <p>
      One of the most common reasons that making the assumption <m>\rho = \textrm{constant}</m>
      does not capture the flow dynamics accurately is if there are significant
      temperature variations within the liquid.
      Typically, liquids expand as the temperature rises, and this leads to <em>thermal convection</em>,
      which needs to be taken into account in the mathematical analysis.

            In the buoyancy term of the momentum conservation equation
      (that is the term <m>\rho g</m> appearing in the Euler equation),
      we assume the density is a linear function of the
      temperature. Thus we write
      <me>\rho = \rho_0(1 - \alpha(T - T_0))</me>,
      where <m>T_0</m> and <m>\rho_0</m>
      are a reference temperature and density, respectively, and <m>\alpha</m> is the

      <answer>
        <p>
          The relationship <m>pV=nRT</m> implies

          since <m>nM</m> is the mass of the gas molecules in <m>V</m> and therefore <m>nM/V</m>
          is the average density.

      </answer>
      <p>In fluid dynamics the form <xref ref="eqn-idealgas"/> is more convenient than <m>pV=nRT</m>
        because it can be applied at each point in the gas, whereas <m>pV=nRT</m> is a law applying
        to a fixed finite volume.</p>

        It is observed empirically that Newtonian viscous fluids interact with

      <me>
          \bu_{\textrm{fluid}} = \bu_{\textrm{wall}}

  <p>
    <remark>
      <p>
        In many cases, <m>\bu_{\textrm{wall}} = \boldsymbol{0}</m>, so the no-slip conditions mean

        </me>
        Note that this condition is weaker than the corresponding one for viscous fluids,
        since it only applies to one component of the velocity.
        As we will shortly see, the extra conditions for viscous fluids are mathematically necessary,
        since the equation for conservation of momentum for viscous fluids has spatial derivatives
        of higher order.

    <title>Force balance at the boundary/interface</title>
    <p>
      In addition to the boundary conditions on the velocity given in
      <xref ref="boundary-conditions-velocity"/>, we sometimes need to apply a <em>force balance</em>
      condition at the boundary of the fluid or at the interface between two fluids in a
      free boundary problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      <remark><title>Rigid boundaries</title>
        <p>
        Thankfully, in the case of a fluid<ndash/>solid boundary, if the solid is rigid
        (which we often assume), the no-slip
        boundary conditions on the velocity are sufficient to solve the problem mathematically.
        If desired, a force balance can be performed after solving the problem, and this determines
        the <em>stress</em> (force per unit area) that the fluid exerts on the solid wall, and we
        can thus find the <em>reaction force</em> that the wall applies in order to maintain
        its position in the presence of the flowing fluid.          
        </p>
      </remark>
    </p>
    <p>
        However, if the solid <em>moves in response to the fluid</em>, either because it is an elastic solid
        or because the solid is not <em>tethered</em>,
        then a force balance is required to solve the problem mathematically. This is
        called a <em>fluid<ndash/>structure interaction problem</em>, and these are typically very difficult to solve.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, at a fluid<ndash/>fluid interface, a force balance is typically
        required to solve the problem. The difference between the stresses of the two
        fluids on the interface (the forces each fluid exerts on the interface per unit
        area of the interface) is balanced by the <em>surface tension</em> that arises
        within the interface.

    <title>Surface tension</title>
    <p>
      The interface between two immiscible fluids (e.g. air and water, or water and mercury) creates
      surface tension, a force per unit length.
      This is of considerable importance in many fluid mechanics problems,
      especially those involving small lengthscales.

      <title>Definition of stress at a surface</title>
      <p>
      The fluid stress on a surface, <m>\btau</m>, is the force per unit area exerted
      by the fluid; note that this is a vector quantity.
      It is often convenient to decompose the stress into two contributions, as these are
      often quite different both in magnitude and in physical origin:
    <ul>
      <li>Shear stress: the components tangential to the surface</li>
      <li>Normal stress: the component perpendicular to the surface.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  </definition>
</p>
    
  <p>
    <example xml:id="example-shear-stress">
      <title>Fluid stress in arteries</title>
      <p>
      The shear stress on arterial walls is everywhere maintained
      at around <m>\sim1.5</m> Pa, whereas the normal stress is typically much larger at ~11–16 kPa.
      The distribution of shear stress, although much smaller than the normal stress,
      is known to be of great importance to our
      health as it is linked to the development of atherosclerosis, which leads to heart attacks
      and strokes, two of the leading causes of death worldwide.

        <li>The normal stress equals the pressure.</li>

              <men xml:id="eq-defofp">
                p=-\frac13\textrm{tr}\left(\bsigma\right)=-\frac13\textrm{tr}\left(\bsigma\right).
              </men>
              This equation gives us a method by which we can (at least in our imagination)
              think about measuring the pressure at a particular point in the fluid.
              We consider three small, mutually orthogonal planes passing through the point
              (aligned perpendicular to the <m>x</m>-, <m>y</m>- and <m>z</m>-directions)
              and measure the three forces on the three surfaces.
              Dividing each force by the area of the respective plane leads to the stresses on the surfaces,
              which are, respectively,
              <me>
              \left(\begin{matrix}\sigma_{11}\\\sigma_{21}\\\sigma_{31}\end{matrix}\right),\quad
              \left(\begin{matrix}\sigma_{12}\\\sigma_{22}\\\sigma_{32}\end{matrix}\right),\quad\textrm{and}\quad
              \left(\begin{matrix}\sigma_{13}\\\sigma_{23}\\\sigma_{33}\end{matrix}\right).
              </me>
              The normal components of the respective stresses are
              <m>\sigma_{11}</m>, <m>\sigma_{22}</m> and <m>\sigma_{33}</m>,
              and hence the pressure is the average of the three normal components of the stresses.
              The interpretation of the pressure is different for compressible and incompressible fluids:

                  <p>
                    <em>Compressible fluids:</em>
                    From classical thermodynamics it is known that we can define the pressure
                    of the fluid as a parameter of state, making use of an equation of state
                    (for example <m>p=\rho RT</m> for an ideal gas).
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <em>Incompressible fluids:</em>
                    For an incompressible fluid the pressure <m>p</m> is an independent,
                    purely dynamical, variable.

              In this course we mainly consider incompressible fluids.

      <title>Derivation of Newtonian fluid stress tensor from first principles</title>
      <p><em>Non-examinable:</em></p>
      <p>
          Newtonian fluids have the following properties:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                The deviatoric part of the stress tensor, <m>\bd</m>, is a linear function
                of the nine velocity gradients,
                <me>(\nabla\bu)_{ij}=\pd{u_j}{x_i}.</me>
                This implies
                <me>d_{ij}=\sum_{l=1}^3\sum_{k=1}^3c_{ijkl}\pd{u_l}{x_k}</me>
                for some unknown scalars <m>c_{ijkl}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The fluid is homogeneous, i.e. <m>\bsigma</m> does not depend explicitly on
                <m>\bx</m>. This implies that the <m>c_{ijkl}</m>'s are constant in space.
                An example of when this would not be the case would be an inhomogeneous fluid,
                such as a fluid that is heated differentially.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The fluid is isotropic, i.e. there is no preferred direction.
                Insisting that <m>\bd</m> transforms correctly under rotations
                (and in fact we only need to consider rotations through <m>90^\circ</m>
                about the coordinate axes) implies that <m>c_{ijkl}</m> is zero unless
                each subscript appears an even number of times. That is, the only non-zero terms
                are <m>c_{1111}</m>, <m>c_{2222}</m>, <m>c_{3333}</m> (which must all be equal),
                and those <m>c_{ijkl}</m>'s in which two of the indices <m>i</m>, <m>j</m>, <m>k</m>, <m>l</m>
                are '1' and two indices are '2', also terms with two `2's and two `3's,
                and terms with two `1's and two `3's (and these obey certain equalities too).
                An example of when this would not be the case would be an anisotropic fluid,
                such as nematic liquid crystals (long chain molecules that align in a magnetic field)
                or flowing blood in which the red blood cells align in the direction of flow).
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          Additionally requiring that <m>\bd</m> is a symmetric matrix means that,
          in component form, we can reduce the <m>c_{ijkl}</m>'s down to just two
          independent scalar parameters, <m>\lambda</m> and <m>\mu</m>, and we have

<!--\paragraph{Notes:}
\begin{itemize}
\item For an {\bf incompressible Newtonian fluid} the bulk viscosity is not defined. In this case we have
\begin{equation}
\bsigma=-p {\bf I} +2\mu {\bf e},\quad\mbox{or}\quad
\sigma_{ij}=-p\delta_{ij}+2\mu e_{ij}=-p\delta_{ij}+\mu\left(\pd{u_j}{x_i}+\pd{u_i}{x_j}\right).
\label{eq:Newtonianconstitutive}
\end{equation}
In Cartesian coordinates, it is
\begin{equation}
\bsigma=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
-p+2\mu\pd{u}{x}&\mu\left(\pd{u}{y}+\pd{v}{x}\right)&\mu\left(\pd{u}{z}+\pd{w}{x}\right)\\
\mu\left(\pd{u}{y}+\pd{v}{x}\right)&-p+2\mu\pd{v}{y}&\mu\left(\pd{v}{z}+\pd{w}{y}\right)\\
\mu\left(\pd{u}{z}+\pd{w}{x}\right)&\mu\left(\pd{v}{z}+\pd{w}{y}\right)&-p+2\mu\pd{w}{z}
\end{array}\right)
\label{eq:cartesiannewtonianstress}
\end{equation}
Since we often consider incompressible Newtonian fluids, for which there is only one viscosity parameter, it is common to refer to the dynamic shear viscosity as simply the {\bf viscosity} of the fluid.

\item {\bf Important caveat:} The normal stress on a surface with normal ${\bf n}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\left(\bsigma{\bf n}\right)\cdot{\bf n}
=-pn_in_i+\lambda n_in_i\pd{u_k}{x_k}+2\mu n_in_j\pd{u_j}{x_i}
=-p+3\lambda\nabla\cdot\bu+2\mu{\bf n}\cdot\nabla\left(\bu\cdot{\bf n}\right).\label{eq:normalstress}
\end{equation}
The last term represents $2\mu$ times the derivative of the normal component of the velocity in the normal direction. {\bf Thus the normal stress is not necessary equal to the pressure!}

\item However, at a fixed solid surface the normal stress of an incompressible Newtonian fluid does equal the pressure. We can show this as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item By rotating the coordinate axes we may assume that ${\bf n}={\bf i}$.
\item From \eqref{eq:normalstress} the normal stress is $-p+2\mu\pd{u}{x}$.
\item Since the fluid is incompressible $\nabla\cdot\bu=\pd{u}{x}+\pd{v}{y}+\pd{w}{z}=0$.
\item The boundary conditions at the solid surface are $u=v=w=0$. Thus $\pd{v}{y}=\pd{w}{z}=0$ on the surface. The continuity equation implies that $\pd{u}{x}=0$ also.
\item Hence the normal stress on the surface is $-p$.
\end{itemize}

\item At a fixed solid surface the shear stress of a Newtonian fluid equals the viscosity multiplied by the derivative of the component of velocity parallel to the surface with respect to the perpendicular coordinate. We can show this as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item As before we may rotate the coordinate axes so that ${\bf n}={\bf i}$.
\item Using Equation~\eqref{eq:Newtonianstress} the stress at the surface is $\btau=\bsigma{\bf n}=-p{\bf i}+\mu(\pd\bu{x}+\nabla u$), and the shear stresses are the tangential ($y$ and $z$) components, $\tau_y=\mu(\pd{v}{x}+\pd{u}{y})$ and $\tau_z=\mu(\pd{w}{x}+\pd{u}{z})$.
\item The boundary conditions at the solid surface are $u=v=w=0$. Thus $\pd{u}{y}=\pd{u}{z}=0$ on the surface.
\item Hence the shear stresses on the surface are $\tau_y=\mu\pd{v}{x}$ and $\tau_z=\mu\pd{w}{x}$.
\end{itemize}

\item It is often mathematically convenient to define the {\bf kinematic viscosity}:
\begin{equation}
\nu=\dfrac{\mu}{\rho}.
\end{equation}

\item {\bf Inviscid fluids:} An incompressible fluid is said to be {\bf inviscid} or {\bf ideal} if $\mu=0$. The constitutive law~\eqref{eq:Newtonianconstitutive} becomes
\begin{equation}
\text{in component form,} \quad \sigma_{ij}=-p\delta_{ij},
\quad \text{or, in vector form,} \quad \bsigma=-p {\bf I},
\label{eq:inviscidconstitutive}
\end{equation}
and thus the stress in the fluid is not affected by the fluid motion. There are no truly inviscid fluids in nature, but in certain cases it is appropriate to approximate by an inviscid fluid, for example for a fast-flowing, low-viscosity fluid.
\end{itemize}

    <remark>
      <title>Non-Newtonian fluids</title>
      <p>
        Many fluids do not obey the constitutive relationship of a Newtonian fluid.
        These are called <em>non-Newtonian fluids</em>, and examples include
        blood, paint, toothpaste, shampoo, custard, cornflour suspension (``oobleck''),
        quicksand, and many others.
        The rheology of non-Newtonian fluids is often very complex,
        and is an area of active research.
      </p>
    </remark>

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Non-Newtonian fluids}
Some fluids exhibit significant non-Newtonian qualities, as reflected in their constitutive relationship, which describes them. Some categories of non-Newtonian fluids:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Non-constant viscosity:} This is perhaps the simplest way a fluid can be non-Newtonian. Examples include shear thinning fluids {\it e.g.}\ blood, and shear-thickening fluids {\it e.g.}\ fluids containing cornflour, or fluids whose viscosity depends on the temperature of the fluid.
\begin{center}
\input{nonnewtonian.pdf_t}
\end{center}
A short fun video that is also quite educational on these sorts of non-Newtonian fluids can be seen at \verb+http://www.teachertube.com/video/walking-on-custard-brainiac-41345+.
\item {\bf Viscoelastic fluids:} These fluids have a memory, and in this case the formula for the deviatoric part of the stress tensor involves an integral over the previous states of the fluid.
\item {\bf Anisotropic fluids:} These are fluids that have different properties in different directions. A physiological example of this is blood, which contains red blood cells. When the blood is flowing the cells align, meaning the effective viscosity is much less in the direction of flow and more in the transverse direction.
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Examples}
We can find the stress $\btau$ (the force per unit area experienced by the fluid) on a surface with unit normal vector ${\bf n}$ using the formula~\eqref{eq:stressonsurface}, which states
\begin{equation}
\btau(\mathbf{n})=\bsigma{\bf n}.
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Example 1a. Shear flow: } Consider an incompressible Newtonian fluid flowing in $y\geq0$ in Cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z)$ in a uniform pressure field $p=p_0$ with $p_0$ constant, and whose velocity components are respectively given by
\begin{equation}
u=ky,\quad v=0,\quad w=0,
\end{equation}
(it may be shown these satisfy the Navier<ndash/>Stokes and continuity equations). Find the stress tensor at a general location. Hence find the stress at a general location on an imaginary surface with unit normal vector ${\bf n}=(n_x,n_y)$. In this question you may neglect gravity.

\begin{center}
\input{sample-flow1.pdf_t}
\end{center}

\paragraph{Answer:} The stress tensor is given by
\begin{equation}
\bsigma=-p{\bf I}+2\mu{\bf e},
\end{equation}
where the rate-of-strain tensor ${\bf e}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
{\bf e}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
\displaystyle{\pd{u}{x}}&\displaystyle{\frac12\left(\pd{u}{y}+\pd{v}{x}\right)}\\
\displaystyle{\frac12\left(\pd{u}{y}+\pd{v}{x}\right)}&\displaystyle{\pd{v}{y}}
\end{array}\right)
=\left(\begin{array}{cc}0&k/2\\k/2&0\end{array}\right).
\end{equation}
Hence the stress tensor $\bsigma$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\bsigma=-p{\bf I}+2\mu{\bf e}
=\left(\begin{array}{cc}-p_0&k\mu\\k\mu&-p_0\end{array}\right).
\end{equation}
Thus for a general unit vector
\begin{equation}
\btau=\bsigma{\bf n}
=\left(\begin{array}{cc}-p_0&k\mu\\k\mu&-p_0\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}n_x\\n_y\end{array}\right)
=\left(\begin{array}{c}-p_0n_x+k\mu n_y\\k\mu n_x-p_0n_y\end{array}\right).
\end{equation}
\paragraph{Notes:}
\begin{itemize}
\item For example with ${\bf n}={\bf j}$, we have $\btau=(k\mu,-p_0)$. This makes sense as there is a background pressure $p_0$ pressing into the surface and a stress $k\mu$ arising from the shear flow and running along the surface. It also agrees with the formula for stress at a surface that was given in Mechanics 2 Fluids (viscosity times the normal derivative of the tangential velocity).
\item Likewise if ${\bf n}={\bf i}$, we have $\btau=(-p_0,k\mu)$. This formula cannot be compared with the formula from Mechanics 2 Fluids as it would not be possible to put in a rigid surface with normal ${\bf n}={\bf i}$ without changing the flow.
\end{itemize}

%%%%
\paragraph{Example 2: Poiseuille flow} Consider Poiseuille flow in a circular cylinder with velocity components
\begin{equation}
u_r=0,\quad u_\theta=0,\quad u_z=\frac{G}{4\mu}\left(a^2-r^2\right),
\end{equation}
where $G=-\partial p/\partial z$ is the axial pressure gradient. Find the stress tensor at a general point and comment on it.

\paragraph{Answer:} We have the rate-of-strain tensor given by \eqref{eq:strainrate-cyl} as
\begin{multline}
{\bf e}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
\pd{u_r}{r}&\frac12\left(r\pd{(u_\theta/r)}{r}+\frac1r\pd{u_r}{\theta}\right)&\frac12\left(\pd{u_z}{r}+\pd{u_r}{z}\right)\\
\frac12\left(r\pd{(u_\theta/r)}{r}+\frac1r\pd{u_r}{\theta}\right)&\frac1r\pd{u_\theta}{\theta}+\frac{u_r}{r}&\frac12\left(\pd{u_\theta}{z}+\frac1r\pd{u_z}{\theta}\right)\\
\frac12\left(\pd{u_z}{r}+\pd{u_r}{z}\right)&\frac12\left(\pd{u_\theta}{z}+\frac1r\pd{u_z}{\theta}\right)&\pd{u_z}{z}
\end{array}\right)\\
=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}0&0&\displaystyle{-\frac{Gr}{4\mu}}\\0&0&0\\\displaystyle{-\frac{Gr}{4\mu}}&0&0\end{array}\right),
\end{multline}
and hence
\begin{equation}
\bsigma=-p{\bf I}+2\mu{\bf e}
=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}-p&0&\displaystyle{-\frac12Gr}\\0&-p&0\\\displaystyle{-\frac12Gr}&0&-p\end{array}\right).
\end{equation}
Incompressibility requires $G$ to be constant, and hence $p=p_0-Gz$, where $p_0$ is a constant, and giving
\begin{equation}
\bsigma=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}-p_0+Gz&0&\displaystyle{-\frac12Gr}\\0&-p_0+Gz&0\\\displaystyle{-\frac12Gr}&0&-p_0+Gz\end{array}\right).
\end{equation}
Hence for imaginary surfaces with normal vectors $\hat{\bf r}$, $\hat{\btheta}$, $\hat{\bf z}$, respectively, the stress on the surface is given by
\begin{align}
\btau_r=&\bsigma\hat{\bf r}=\left(Gz-p_0\right)\hat{\bf r}-\frac12Gr\hat{\bf z},\\
\btau_\theta=&\bsigma\hat{\btheta}=\left(Gz-p_0\right)\hat{\btheta},\\
\btau_z=&\bsigma\hat{\bf z}=\left(Gz-p_0\right)\hat{\bf z}-\frac12Gr\hat{\bf r}.
\end{align}
It is not possible to compare these formulae with the one given in Mechanics 2 Fluids, because a rigid surface with the given normal vectors could not be put in, except for the case when we find the stress at the wall ($r=a$) by setting the normal vector is ${\bf n}=-\hat{\bf r}$, which gives
\begin{equation}
\btau=-\bsigma\hat{\bf r}=\left(p_0-Gz\right)\hat{\bf r}+\frac12Ga\hat{\bf z},
\end{equation}
that is a normal stress equal to minus the pressure and an axial shear stress $Ga/2$ (which is $-\mu\,\partial u_z/\partial r$, as expected).

  <title>Conservation of linear momentum</title>
    <p>
      We consider the balance of linear momentum
      in a small cube of side length <m>\delta</m> for an <em>incompressible fluid</em>.
      <figure xml:id="fig-small-cube">
       <caption>Small cube used to derive the equations of motion</caption>
       <image source="ch-chapter07-small-cube.jpg" width="50%">
       <shortdescription>Small cube</shortdescription>
       </image>
       </figure>
      To do this we employ the Reynolds Transport Theorem <xref ref="eqn-RTT"/>,
      with <m>\bf(\bx,t)</m> equal to the linear momentum of the fluid per unit volume,
      <m>\bf=\rho\bu</m>, and <m>V(t)</m> being the small volume of fluid under consideration,
      which coincides with the cube at time <m>t</m> (however, note that the volume of fluid
      we are following is not generally a cube at other times). The theorem states that:
      <me>
        \dd{}{t} \iiint_{V(t)} f \, \de{x} \, \de{y} \, \de{z} = \iiint_{V(t)} \left[
        \pd{f}{t} + \nabla \cdot (f\bu)\right] \, \de{x} \, \de{y} \, \de{z}.
      </me>
    </p>
    <p>
      We note that <m>\iiint_{V(t)} f \, \de{x} \, \de{y} \, \de{z}</m> is the integral of the
      linear momentum per unit volume over the volume and is therefore the total momentum
      of the fluid particles in <m>V(t)</m>. The left-hand side of this equation is thus
      the Lagrangian rate of change of momentum of these fluid particles.
      By Newton's second law, this must equal the total force acting on the fluid
      in <m>V(t)</m>, which we denote by <m>\bF</m>. This force has different contributions, which
      can be categorised into body forces (which act on the whole control volume)
      and surface forces (acting only on the surface, which arise from the fluid stress).
      In this course, the contributions to the force <m>\bF</m> are:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Body forces:</em> usually equal to either zero (if gravity is not important)
            or equal to the gravitational force
            <me>
              \bF_{\textrm{gravity}}=\rho V\bg.
            </me>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <em>Surface forces:</em> these arise from the stress exerted at the surface of the fluid parcel
            volume and can be computed by integrating the stress vector <m>\tau</m> over the surface of the cube.
            Recall that the stress is composed of contributions from the pressure and the viscous contributions:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                <em>pressure:</em> We calculate the force due to the pressure acting on the fluid in the cube.
                To simplify matters, we assume that the cube is small enough that the pressures can be taken as
                uniform over each of the faces.
                The component of the force in the <m>x</m>-direction equals pressure times area on the left
                face minus that on the right face, that is <m>\delta^2p|_x-\delta^2p|_{x+\delta}</m>,
                and since <m>\delta</m> is small, this is approximately
                <me>-\delta^3\pd{p}{x}=-V\pd{p}{x},</me>
                Note that this result is not entirely obvious, as we have not carefully integrated over the surface,
                rather we have just said that the force is pressure on the surface times area,
                without specifying at which point the pressure should be taken.
                Thus it is not immediately clear that the <m>y</m>- and <m>z</m>-components of the
                representative point in the expression <m>\delta^2p|_x</m>
                are the same as those in the expression <m>-\delta^2p|_{x+\delta}</m>,
                and note that if these are not close enough,
                then <m>\delta^2p|_x-\delta^2p|_{x+\delta}\approx-V\pd{p}{x}</m> wouldn't be true.
                Happily, with a bit more work (not included here), it can be shown that this is indeed the case.
                </p>
                <p>
                Hence the pressure force on the fluid in the cuboid is
                <me>
                -V\pd{p}{x}{\bf i}-V\pd{p}{y}{\bf j}-V\pd{p}{z}{\bf k}=-V\nabla p.
                </me>
                This result is completely general, and shows that the pressure force per unit
                volume of the fluid equals
                <me>
                  \boxed{\bF_{\textrm{pressure}}=-\nabla p},
                </me>
                which is a useful result in its own right.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                <em>viscous:</em> For an incompressible Newtonian fluid the viscous forces are
                given by <m>\bF_{\textrm{viscous}}\approx V\mu\nabla^2\bu</m>.
                </p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    
<!--Thus
\begin{equation}
{\bf F}={\bf F}_{\mbox{gravity}}+{\bf F}_{\mbox{pressure}}+{\bf F}_{\mbox{viscous}}
\approx\rho V{\bf g}-V\nabla p+V\mu\nabla^2\bu
\label{eqn:forceoncontrolvol}
\end{equation}

As for mass conservation Section~\ref{sect:diffmasscons} we evaluate the integrals in the Reynolds Transport Theorem, and expand the variables (velocity, density) as Taylor series within the box. As we let $\delta$ tend to zero we obtain
\begin{equation}
\rho\left(\pd{\bu}{t}
+\left(\bu\cdot\nabla\right)\bu\right)
=-\nabla p+\mu\nabla^2\bu+\rho{\bf g},
\label{eqn:navierstokes}
\end{equation}
which, in component form in Cartesian coordinates with ${\bf g}=(0,0,-g)$, is
\begin{align}
\rho\left(\pd{u}{t}
+u\pd{u}{x}+v\pd{u}{y}+w\pd{u}{z}\right)
=&-\pd{p}{x}+\mu\nabla^2u,\label{eqn:navierstokesx}\\
\rho\left(\pd{v}{t}
+u\pd{v}{x}+v\pd{v}{y}+w\pd{v}{z}\right)
=&-\pd{p}{y}+\mu\nabla^2v,\label{eqn:navierstokesy}\\
\rho\left(\pd{w}{t}
+u\pd{w}{x}+v\pd{w}{y}+w\pd{w}{z}\right)
=&-\pd{p}{z}+\mu\nabla^2w-\rho g,\label{eqn:navierstokesz}
\end{align}
The incompressible Navier<ndash/>Stokes equation~(\ref{eqn:navierstokes}) together with the incompressible continuity equation~(\ref{eqn:massconsrhoconst}) is often used to study problems encountered in fluid dynamics and it was developed by Claude-Louis Navier (1785<ndash/>1836) and George Gabriel Stokes (1819<ndash/>1903).

\paragraph{Notes:}
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Force terms:} On comparsion with equation~(\ref{eqn:forceoncontrolvol}), we see that the terms on the right-hand side of (\ref{eqn:navierstokes}) are the force per unit volume acting on the fluid in the control volume.
\item {\bf Inertial terms:} The terms on the left-hand side of (\ref{eqn:navierstokes}) represent inertial effects, since
\begin{equation}
\frac{D\bu}{Dt}=\pd{\bu}{t}+(\bu\cdot\nabla)\bu
\end{equation}
is the material acceleration (that is the acceleration moving with the fluid).  Thus the left-hand side is rate of change of momentum of a fluid particle. In fact, the differential operator
\begin{equation}
\frac{D}{Dt}=\pd{}{t}+(\bu\cdot\nabla)
\end{equation}
is called the material derivative, and its action on a quantity results in the rate of change in time of that quantity, moving along with the fluid.\footnote{All equations representing transport of a quantity will have this operator in them: the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equation finds momentum transport, whilst the continuity equations finds mass transport, and can be arranged as follows:
\begin{equation}
\frac{D\rho}{Dt}=-\rho\nabla\cdot\bu.
\end{equation}
In the course Heat and Mass Transport 2 next term you will be introduced to the governing equation for heat transport, which involves $DT/Dt$ where $T$ is temperature, and the governing equation for mass transport, which involves $Dc/Dt$, where $c$ is concentration of a species.}
\item {\bf Variables to be solved for:} In problems where the fluid is incompressible, there are four unknown variables, $u$, $v$, $w$ and $p$, and as we would expect there are four equations governing their behaviour, which are~(\ref{eqn:massconsrhoconst}), (\ref{eqn:navierstokesx}), (\ref{eqn:navierstokesy}) and (\ref{eqn:navierstokesz}).
\item {\bf Flow in two dimensions:} Life is often made much simpler if we approximate the flow as being two-dimensional (in the $(x,y)$-plane). In this case, we can assume that $w=0$ and set $\pd{}{z}$ of anything to be zero. We get
\begin{align*}
&\pd{u}{x}+\pd{v}{y}=0,\\
&\rho\left(\pd{u}{t}+u\pd{u}{x}+v\pd{u}{y}\right)
=-\pd{p}{x}+\mu\left(\pd{^2u}{x^2}+\pd{^2u}{y^2}\right),\\
&\rho\left(\pd{v}{t}+u\pd{v}{x}+v\pd{v}{y}\right)
=-\pd{p}{y}+\mu\left(\pd{^2v}{x^2}+\pd{^2v}{y^2}\right).
\end{align*}
The special case of an axisymmetric flow (one that is rotationally symmetric) is also much simpler to analyse (and sometimes this is also referred to as being two-dimensional). If the flow is two-dimensional then this allows a new variable called the streamfunction, usually denoted $\psi$, to be introduced. The equations can all be written in terms of $\psi$, which can make solving them easier. This is beyond the scope of the course, and more details are provided in the supplementary notes.
\item {\bf Comparison with control volume analysis:} Solving these equations can be an alternative method of solution for problems to the control volume analysis of the previous section. The choice of whether to use the control volume method or the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations to solve a problem depends on the information known and required. To use the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations, specific details of the domain and initial conditions are needed, whereas control volume analysis works with integrated quantities, meaning that it can be used if average values are provided.
\item {\bf Non-inertial reference frames:} As with linear momentum conservation, the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations can be adapted for use in a non-inertial reference frame:
\begin{equation}
\rho\left(\td{\bu_\non}{t}+\bu_\non\cdot\nabla_\non\bu_\non\right)=-\nabla_\non p+\mu\nabla_\non^2\bu_\non+\rho{\bf f}_{\sf apparent}+\rho{\bf g}_\non,
\end{equation}
where $\nabla_\non$ is the gradient operator with respect to the non-inertial coordinates and ${\bf f}_{\sf apparent}$ is the apparent intensive force given by~\eqref{eq:apparentintensiveforce}.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Momentum conservation for inviscid fluids}
Inviscid fluids have no viscosity ($\mu=0$), which is often a good approximation when the flow has a high Reynolds number.  In this case linear momentum conservation gives the \boxed{\mbox{{\bf Euler equation}}}:
\begin{equation}
\rho\left(\pd{\bu}{t}
+\left(\bu\cdot\nabla\right)\bu\right)
=-\nabla p+\rho{\bf g},
\label{eqn:euler}
\end{equation}
which was discovered by Leonhard Euler (1707<ndash/>1783), together with the continuity equation can be used to solve the system.

\paragraph{Examples of Non-Newtonian fluids}
Many fluids are non-Newtonian in character. Examples of the ways that fluids can be non-Newtonian are:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Non-constant viscosity:} Some fluids have a different effective viscosities under different conditions. Blood and custard both have a so-called `shear-dependent' viscosity, that is the viscosity is different according to how much shear stress there is in the flow, whilst for example golden syrup has different properties at different temperatures.
\begin{itemize}
{\bf Blood:} A particular example of a non-Newtonian fluid is blood, and the reason for its special rheology is primarily due to the presence of red blood cells. The beautiful picture below is a numerical (computer) simulation of blood flow in a microvessel performed by the Biological Flow Studies Laboratory in Tohoku University, Japan (see \texttt{http://www.pfsl.mech.tohoku.ac.jp/\allowbreak contents/\allowbreak research/\allowbreak microcirculation.html}). The left picture shows the view of the blood from the outside (with the walls removed), whilst that on the right shows the view in the central plane of the vessel.
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{microcirculation1.jpg}
\end{center}
In large arteries it is usually acceptable to model blood as a Newtonian fluid because the diameter of the artery is many times that of the cells. However, for small arteries, such as that pictured above, the Newtonian model does not give an accurate picture.
\end{itemize}

\item {\bf Viscoelastic fluids:} These are fluids that have both elastic and viscous properties, that is the molecules seem to have a memory and spring back when they are suddenly displaced (but not so much when they are slowly displaced, that is they have a `fading memory'. Examples include mucus and vitreous humour.

\item {\bf Anisotropic properties:} A few fluids respond differently to stress applied in different directions. \begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth]{LiquidCrystal-MesogenOrder-Nematic.jpg}
\end{center}
The picture shows a schematic representation of nematic liquid crystals, which are used in computer displays, electronic signs etc. These align by themselves to a preferred direction for high enough temperatures, and a magnetic field can be used to set the direction.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Other examples of non-Newtonian fluids:} Many foods and household products, e.g.\ egg white, custard, shampoo, have non-Newtonian rheology. In the case of foods, this is often because the non-Newtonian properties themselves lend a texture that makes them taste better! For household products the non-Newtonian properties help us use them (for example a Newtonian shampoo might drain off our hair before we have a chance to work it in).

The Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations do not work for non-Newtonian case, and the pressure and viscous terms must be replaced by a formula that captures the rheology. However, for a surprisingly large number of fluids in many circumstances, the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations do in fact provide a remarkably good description of the behaviour.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Example of application of Navier<ndash/>Stokes and continuity equations}
(Based on Problem 4.34 in White).  Consider an incompressible Newtonian fluid flowing in a gravitational field ${\bf g}=-g{\bf k}$ with velocity
\begin{equation}
\bu=Kx{\bf i}+Ky{\bf j}-2Kz{\bf k}.
\end{equation}
Check that this flow satisfies the continuity and Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations, and find the pressure field.

To check the continuity equation, we consider
\begin{equation}
\nabla\cdot\bu=K+K-2K=0,
\end{equation}
so this is satisfied.

The Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations are
\begin{equation}
\rho\left(\pd{\bu}{t}
+(\bu\cdot\nabla)\bu\right)
=-\nabla p+\mu\nabla^2\bu-\rho g{\bf k}.
\end{equation}
For the flow given
\begin{itemize}
\item $\partial\bu/\partial t=0$,
\item $\displaystyle{
\bu\cdot\nabla
=Kx\pd{}{x}+Ky\pd{}{y}-2Kz\pd{}{z}}$, which gives
\begin{equation}
(\bu\cdot\nabla)\bu
=K^2x{\bf i}+K^2y{\bf j}+4K^2z{\bf k},
\end{equation}
\item $\nabla^2\bu=0$.
\end{itemize}
So the components of the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations become
\begin{equation}\rho K^2x=-\pd{p}{x},\quad
\rho K^2y=-\pd{p}{y},\quad
4\rho K^2z=-\pd{p}{z}-\rho g.\end{equation}
The question of whether the flow satisfies the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations now becomes a question of whether we can find a pressure field $p$ satisfying each of these equations. The first equation has solution
\begin{equation*}
p=-\frac12\rho K^2x^2+f_1(y,z),
\end{equation*}
and substituting this solution into the second equation gives
\begin{align*}
&\pd{f_1}{y}=-\rho K^2y\\
\Rightarrow\quad
&f_1(y,z)=-\frac12\rho K^2y^2+f_2(z)\\
\Rightarrow\quad
&p=-\frac12\rho K^2(x^2+y^2)+f_2(z),
\end{align*}
and substituting this solution into the third equation gives
\begin{align*}
&\td{f_2}{z}=-4\rho K^2z-\rho g\\
\Rightarrow\quad
&f_2(z)=-2\rho K^2z^2-\rho gz+p_0\\
\Rightarrow\quad
&p=-\frac12\rho K^2(x^2+y^2+4z^2)-\rho gz+p_0.
\end{align*}
Since we have found an expression for the pressure that satisfies all three components of the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations, we can say that the given flow does satisfy the equations.

\paragraph{Notes}
\begin{itemize}
\item Note that in general if we have an expression for $\nabla p$, say we know that $\nabla p={\bf q}$, then we can check whether or not it it is possible to find $p$ by taking the curl of both sides, {\it   i.e.} $\nabla\times{\bf q}=\nabla\times\nabla p=0$ (since $\nabla\times\nabla f=0$ for all functions $f$).  If ${\bf q}$ satisfies $\nabla\times{\bf q}=0$ then it is possible to find a pressure field (and hence the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations are satisfied), otherwise it is not.  In this example
\begin{equation}
\nabla p=-\rho K^2x{\bf i}-\rho K^2y{\bf j}
-(4\rho K^2z+\rho g){\bf k},
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\nabla\times\left(-\rho K^2x{\bf i}-\rho K^2y{\bf j}
-(4\rho K^2z+\rho g){\bf k}\right)=0,
\end{equation}
as expected.
\item It is quite possible for a flow not to satisfy the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations. For example the similar looking flow
\begin{equation}
\bu=K(x+y){\bf i}+Ky{\bf j}-2Kz{\bf k},\label{eq:altflow}
\end{equation}
does satisfy the continuity equation, but has
\begin{equation}
\bu\cdot\nabla\bu=K^2(x+2y){\bf i}+K^2y{\bf j}+4K^2z{\bf k}.
\end{equation}
The Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations would give
\begin{equation}
\nabla p=-\left(-\rho K^2(x+2y),-\rho K^2y,-4\rho K^2z-\rho g\right).
\end{equation}
Trying to solve this from the first equation would give
\begin{equation*}
p=-\frac12\rho K^2(x^2+4xy)+f_1(y,z),
\end{equation*}
and substituting this solution into the second equation gives
\begin{equation*}
-2\rho K^2x+\pd{f_1}{y}=-\rho K^2y\quad\Rightarrow\quad
\pd{f_1}{y}=2\rho K^2x-\rho K^2y.
\end{equation*}
This is a contradiction as $f_1$ is supposed to be a function of $y$ and $z$ only, but here the right-hand side depends on $x$, meaning that $f_1$ has to depend on $x$. Alternatively we could show that the curl of $\nabla p$ is non-zero, which also implies a contradiction.

If the flow were given at a particular point in time by \eqref{eq:altflow}, what do you think would happen next?

For slowly moving spheres, the resistive force is given by Stokes

The initial condition is <m>u=0</m> at <m>t=0</m>, and, substituting this into the above equation,
<m>0=\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}+c</m>, giving <m>c=-\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}</m>. Hence
<me>
u=\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}\left(1-e^{-\frac{3\pi\mu D}{m}t}\right).
</me>
We substitute <m>u_t=\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}</m> and <m>\tau=\frac{m}{3\pi\mu D}</m>. With these substitutions we get
<me>
u=u_t\left(1-e^{-t/\tau}\right).
</me>
The physical significance of these choices is that <m>u_t</m> is the terminal velocity of the sphere and <m>\tau</m> is the timescale over which the velocity of the sphere approaches the terminal velocity. Every <m>\tau</m> units of time, the velocity of the sphere becomes closer to the terminal velocity <m>u_t</m> by a factor <m>e\approx2.7</m>.

If the ballbearing has diameter 2 mm and is falling through glycerol at 20<m>^\circ</m>C, what is its terminal velocity in mm/s and what is the timescale taken to reach the terminal velocity? You may assume that the dynamic viscosity of glycerol at 20<m>^\circ</m>C is 1.2 Pa s and the density of steel is 8,000 kg/m<m>^3</m>.
</p>
<answer>
<p>
Using the fact that the volume of a sphere is <m>\pi D^3/6</m>, where <m>D</m> is the diameter,
we have <m>m=\pi\rho_sD^3/6</m>, where <m>\rho_s=8,000</m> kg/m<m>^3</m>. Thus
<md>
<mrow>u_t=\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}=\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}=\frac{\rho_sgD^2}{18\mu}</mrow>
<mrow>=\frac{8000\times9.81\times(4\times10^{-6})}{18\times1.2}
=0.0146\,\mbox{m/s}=14.6\,\mbox{mm/s}.</mrow>
</md>
The timescale <m>\tau</m> is given by
<me>
\tau=\frac{m}{3\pi\mu D}=\frac{\rho_sD^2}{18\mu}=\frac{8000\times4\times10^{-6}}{18\times1.2}
=0.00148\,\mbox{s}.

Comment on the experimental set up needed to measure the terminal velocity.
</p>
<answer>
<p>
The ball would attain its terminal velocity very quickly (in much less than a second),
and since <m>u_t</m> is on order of centimetres per second, a container of about 10 cm
deep would be suitable for measurement. In fact this idea is commonly used to measure
the viscosity of fluids (since the viscosity can be calculated from the terminal velocity);
this is called a <em>falling ball viscometer</em>.
