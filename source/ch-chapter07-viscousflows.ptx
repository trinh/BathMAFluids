  <title>Viscous flows</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      So far in this course, you have been considering <em>inviscid flows</em>,
      that is flows in which the fluid <em>viscosity</em> is not important.
      In this chapter we introduce the effect of <em>viscosity</em> into the dynamics.
      Fluid <em>viscosity</em> is a friction effect internal to the fluid, and it arises
      due to layers of fluid sliding over each other during fluid motion.
      Including viscosity in our fluid model will lead to the famous Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations,
      which are the governing equations for many fluid flows of practical interest.
      In many real life applications, the effect of viscosity completely changes
      the nature of the fluid flow from that which would be observed with an inviscid fluid,
      and this effect can be confined to a region of the fluid or can be throughout the entire flow.

      Flows that can be described as inviscid include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            free surface flows, such as water waves in the ocean,
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            aerodynamic flow, such as flow past an aircraft wing or a car body at high speed.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      Even in some of these flows, the effect of viscosity is important, for example in the flow past an
      aerodynamic body there is a thin layer of fluid close to the body surface,
      called a <em>boundary layer</em>, in which viscous effects are important. Flows that are completely
      dominated by viscosity are called <em>viscous flows</em>, and these tend to include flows that are
      on a small spatial scale, have a low velocity scale, or are of a particularly viscous fluid, for example:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Many flows in internal physiology, for example the flow of blood through blood vessels,
            especially capillaries (the smallest vessels), the flow of mucus in the respiratory system,
            fluid flows within tissues, the flow of synovial fluid in joints.
            These are often on a small spatial scale and have a low velocity scale.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Several manufacturing processes, for example paint, adhesives or food products,
            since the spatial scales involved are not large and the fluids are often quite viscous.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Other examples include lubricating flows, such as ball bearings and glacier flow.

      <title>Viscosity</title>
      <p>
        Viscosity quantifies the fluid's internal resistance to flow when a force is applied
        (the higher the resistance the higher the viscosity). One of the most common
        mathematical models of an idealised fluid is a
        <em>Newtonian</em> fluid, which will be defined precisely in <xref ref="subsec-newtonian-fluids"/>.
        For these fluids, the shear viscosity
        <m>\mu</m> (sometimes called dynamic viscosity, or just viscosity) is a scalar quantity.
        In S.I. units, it is measured in <m>\textrm{Pa\,s} = \mathrm{kg\,m^{-1}\,s^{-1}}</m>.
      </p>
      <example xml:id="example-viscosity">
        <title>Thought experiment to measure viscosity</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            We could imagine a thought experiment to measure the shear viscosity of a fluid as follows, see
            also <xref ref="fig-viscosity-measurement"/>.
            A solid block of area <m>A</m> floats on the surface of a thin layer of the fluid of
            thickness <m>h</m>. The block is pushed with a force <m>F</m> parallel to the surface of the fluid,
            causing it to move with a steady velocity <m>U</m>. The shear viscosity is given by
            <me>
              \mu = \frac{F h}{A U}.
            </me>
            In principle this formula could be used to determine the viscosity of a fluid
            experimentally; however, in practice it is more common to use a falling ball viscometer (see
            <xref ref="ps-falling-ball-viscometer"/> in the worksheet at the end of this chapter).

      <p>
        The shear viscosity of air increases with increasing temperature,
        whereas that of water decreases with increasing temperature.
        This is typical behaviour for gases and liquids, respectively.
        Many real fluids have more complicated viscosity
        properties, for example blood, mucus, shampoo, egg white and custard.
        In this course we mainly consider Newtonian fluids, thereby avoiding a lot of complexity!
      </p>

      <remark>
        <p>
          Note that we have not yet formally defined the shear viscosity, although the
          example given in <xref ref="example-viscosity"/> provides an informal definition.
          This concept will be formalised in <xref ref="sec-stress"/>.

      <title>Reynolds number</title>
      <p>
        This is one of the most important flow parameters in the study of fluid dynamics,
        as its order of magnitude determines many of the qualitative features of the flow.
        In a given flow, it quantifies the relative importance of inertial and viscous effects.
      </p>
      <definition>
        <title>The Reynolds number</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            The Reynolds number is a dimensionless quantity, defined by
            <me>
              \textrm{Re} = \frac{\rho U L}{\mu} = \frac{U L}{\nu},
            </me>
            where <m>U</m> is a <em>characteristic</em> (or typical) velocity of the flow
            and <m>L</m> is a <em>characteristic</em> lengthscale. It equals the typical size
            of an inertial acceleration divided by a typical size of a viscous acceleration in the flow.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>
      <remark xml:id="example-choice-of-scales">
        <title>Choice of characteristic scales</title>
        <p>
          What do we pick as the <em>characteristic</em> length and velocity scales?
          This is something that gets easier with increasing experience.
          For a given problem there are usually ‘natural’ scales that arise within it.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an illustrative example of how we might think about choosing suitable scales,
          consider a steady flow along a pipe with a circular
          cross-section. An appropriate choice of <m>L</m> could be the pipe radius
          or diameter, while an appropriate value of <m>U</m> could be the velocity
          along the centreline (axis) of the pipe or the average velocity across
          the pipe cross-section (equal to the volumetric flux (volume per unit time)
          of fluid passing along the pipe divided by the cross-sectional area of the pipe).
        </p>
        <p>
          Different choices of scales
          (for example radius vs. diameter and centreline vs. average velocity
          in the pipe example given in <xref ref="example-choice-of-scales"/>)
          would lead to different numerical values of <m>\textrm{Re}</m>. However, note:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                The order of magnitude of the Reynolds number is the same for all choices.
                Thus, when describing a flow, the value of <m>\textrm{Re}</m> is often
                quoted as an order-of-magnitude property.

                If we give detailed information about exactly which
                length and velocity scales are being used then
                we can directly compare different values of <m>\textrm{Re}</m>,
                even if they are of the same order of magnitude.
                For example, we might do this in a plot of a property
                of the flow against the Reynolds number. In this case,
                it would be good scientific practice to specify the
                choice of velocity and length scales used.

        <title>Flow characteristics at different Reynolds numbers</title>
        <p>
          Typical characteristics of the flow are strongly associated with the order of magnitude
          of the Reynolds number:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><em>Low-Reynolds-number flows (<m>Re \ll 1</m>):</em>
                <ul>
                  <li>Examples include several biological examples, such as flow in capillaries
                    (the smallest blood vessels) swimming bacteria or other single cell organisms,
                    lymphatic system flow, and other examples include microfluidics,
                    glacier flow, and spreading honey on toast.</li>
                  <li>These flows are called Stokes flows (after G. G. Stokes who studied them) or creeping flows.</li>
                  <li>Low-Reynolds-number flows are also reversible, meaning that if a force is applied,
                    followed by the reverse of that force then the fluid particles return to their original positions.

      <remark>
        <title>Turbulent flow</title>
        <p>
          This is a qualitative type of flow that is characterised as having many
          different length scales, and the flow is mathematically <em>chaotic</em>.
          Chaotic flow means that fluid particles that start close together can become
          widely separated over time. As well as the scale of the whole experiment,
          the turbulence has eddies on all small length scales.
          Turbulent flows are analysed mathematically by decomposing the fluid velocity into a
          <em>mean flow</em>, which describes the large-scale flow and a <em>fluctuating flow</em>,
          which describes the eddies. Equations can be written for each of these,
          but this decomposition leads to the so-called <em>closure problem</em>,
          in which an assumption needs to be made to provide a final equation that
          governs the dynamics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turbulence is of great importance in applications such as aeronautical
          engineering, weather forecasting and large-scale industrial flows,
          basically because large and fast moving flows have a sufficiently high Reynolds
          number that turbulence is unavoidable and it dominates the flow
          characteristics.
        </p>
        <p>
          The study of turbulence could constitute a lecture course in its own right,
          and therefore a detailed analysis is beyond the scope of this course.

      <title>State relations</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          In addition to the balances implied by mass and momentum conservation that
          you have so far been working on in this course, there is an additional condition needed,
          and this is called
          a <em>state relation</em>. This relates the thermodynamic variables density <m>\rho</m>,
          pressure <m>p</m> and temperature <m>T</m>. In this section, we give two of the most
          common state relations that are used mathematically,
          the first for liquids and the second for gases.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <subsubsection>
        <title>Liquids</title>
        <p>
          Liquids are often assumed to be incompressible, that is we assume
          <m>\rho = \textrm{constant}</m>.
          This is the most common assumption made in this course. However, it is important
          to be aware that it is not always appropriate.
        </p>
        <remark>
          <p>
            One of the most common reasons that making the assumption <m>\rho = \textrm{constant}</m>
            does not capture the flow dynamics accurately is if there are significant
            temperature variations within the liquid.
            Typically, liquids expand as the temperature rises, and this leads to <em>thermal convection</em>,
            which needs to be taken into account in the mathematical analysis.

            <em>Proof that this is equivalent to <xref ref="eqn-idealgas"/>.</em>

          <p>In fluid dynamics the form <xref ref="eqn-idealgas"/> is more convenient than <m>pV=nRT</m>

            <em>no-slip condition</em>. When solving problems in fluid
            mechanics we usually apply these relationships to provide boundary conditions.

          Note that this condition is weaker than the corresponding one for viscous fluids,
          since it only applies to one component of the velocity.
          As we will shortly see, the extra conditions for viscous fluids are mathematically necessary,
          since the equation for conservation of momentum for viscous fluids has spatial derivatives
          of higher order.

      <title>Force balance at the boundary/interface</title>
      <p>
        In addition to the boundary conditions on the velocity given in
        <xref ref="boundary-conditions-velocity"/>, we sometimes need to apply a <em>force balance</em>
        condition at the boundary of the fluid or at the interface between two fluids in a
        free boundary problem.
      </p>
      <remark><title>Rigid boundaries</title>
        <p>
          Thankfully, in the case of a fluid<ndash/>solid boundary, if the solid is rigid
          (which we often assume), the no-slip
          boundary conditions on the velocity are sufficient to solve the problem mathematically.
          If desired, a force balance can be performed after solving the problem, and this determines
          the <em>stress</em> (force per unit area) that the fluid exerts on the solid wall, and we
          can thus find the <em>reaction force</em> that the wall applies in order to maintain
          its position in the presence of the flowing fluid.          
        </p>
      </remark>
      <p>
        However, if the solid <em>moves in response to the fluid</em>, either because it is an elastic solid
        or because the solid is not <em>tethered</em>,
        then a force balance is required to solve the problem mathematically. This is
        called a <em>fluid<ndash/>structure interaction problem</em>,
        and these are typically very difficult to solve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, at a fluid<ndash/>fluid interface, a force balance is typically
        required to solve the problem. The difference between the stresses of the two
        fluids on the interface (the forces each fluid exerts on the interface per unit
        area of the interface) is balanced by the <em>surface tension</em> that arises
        within the interface.

      <title>Surface tension</title>
      <p>
        The interface between two immiscible fluids (e.g. air and water, or water and mercury) creates
        surface tension, a force per unit length.
        This is of considerable importance in many fluid mechanics problems,
        especially those involving small lengthscales.

            The fluid stress on a surface, <m>\btau</m>, is the force per unit area exerted

            It is often convenient to decompose the stress into two contributions, as these are

        <title>Defining the fluid pressure in terms of the stress tensor</title>
        <p>
          We can now write a mathematical definition of the fluid pressure in terms
          of the stress tensor:
          <men xml:id="eq-defofp">
            p=-\frac13\textrm{tr}\left(\bsigma\right)=-\frac13\textrm{tr}\left(\bsigma\right).
          </men>
          This equation gives us a method by which we can (at least in our imagination)
          think about measuring the pressure at a particular point in the fluid.
          We consider three small, mutually orthogonal planes passing through the point
          (aligned perpendicular to the <m>x</m>-, <m>y</m>- and <m>z</m>-directions)
          and measure the three forces on the three surfaces.
          Dividing each force by the area of the respective plane leads to the stresses on the surfaces,
          which are, respectively,
          <me>
            \left(\begin{matrix}\sigma_{11}\\\sigma_{21}\\\sigma_{31}\end{matrix}\right),\quad
            \left(\begin{matrix}\sigma_{12}\\\sigma_{22}\\\sigma_{32}\end{matrix}\right),
            \quad\textrm{and}\quad
            \left(\begin{matrix}\sigma_{13}\\\sigma_{23}\\\sigma_{33}\end{matrix}\right).
          </me>
          The normal components of the respective stresses are
          <m>\sigma_{11}</m>, <m>\sigma_{22}</m> and <m>\sigma_{33}</m>,
          and hence the pressure is the average of the three normal components of the stresses.
          The interpretation of the pressure is different for compressible and incompressible fluids:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                <em>Compressible fluids:</em>
                From classical thermodynamics it is known that we can define the pressure
                of the fluid as a parameter of state, making use of an equation of state
                (for example <m>p=\rho RT</m> for an ideal gas).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <em>Incompressible fluids:</em>
                For an incompressible fluid the pressure <m>p</m> is an independent,
                purely dynamical, variable.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          In this course we mainly consider incompressible fluids.

          is a multiple of the identity matrix and the only stresses are due to the pressure.

        <title>The constitutive relationship of a fluid</title>
        <statement>
          <p>
            This is an equation that describes the relationship between the stress tensor
            and the kinematic state of the fluid. It is found from experiments,
            and governs the mechanical behaviour of the fluid, that is the <em>rheology</em> of the fluid.
            Together with the equations of mass and momentum conservation,
            this closes the problem for the velocity and pressure fields.
            Every fluid obeying the continuum approximation has a constitutive relationship,
            which can be thought of as a definition of its mechanical properties.

            Newton was also responsible for the laws of motion and universal gravitation,

        <title>Derivation of Newtonian fluid stress tensor from first principles</title>
        <p><em>Non-examinable:</em></p>
        <p>
          Newtonian fluids have the following properties:
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                The deviatoric part of the stress tensor, <m>\bd</m>, is a linear function
                of the nine velocity gradients,
                <me>(\nabla\bu)_{ij}=\pd{u_j}{x_i}.</me>
                This implies
                <me>d_{ij}=\sum_{l=1}^3\sum_{k=1}^3c_{ijkl}\pd{u_l}{x_k}</me>
                for some unknown scalars <m>c_{ijkl}</m>.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The fluid is homogeneous, i.e. <m>\bsigma</m> does not depend explicitly on
                <m>\bx</m>. This implies that the <m>c_{ijkl}</m>'s are constant in space.
                An example of when this would not be the case would be an inhomogeneous fluid,
                such as a fluid that is heated differentially.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                The fluid is isotropic, i.e. there is no preferred direction.
                Insisting that <m>\bd</m> transforms correctly under rotations
                (and in fact we only need to consider rotations through <m>90^\circ</m>
                about the coordinate axes) implies that <m>c_{ijkl}</m> is zero unless
                each subscript appears an even number of times. That is, the only non-zero terms
                are <m>c_{1111}</m>, <m>c_{2222}</m>, <m>c_{3333}</m> (which must all be equal),
                and those <m>c_{ijkl}</m>'s in which two of the indices
                <m>i</m>, <m>j</m>, <m>k</m>, <m>l</m>
                are '1' and two indices are '2', also terms with two `2's and two `3's,
                and terms with two `1's and two `3's (and these obey certain equalities too).
                An example of when this would not be the case would be an anisotropic fluid,
                such as nematic liquid crystals (long chain molecules that align in a magnetic field)
                or flowing blood in which the red blood cells align in the direction of flow).
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
          Additionally requiring that <m>\bd</m> is a symmetric matrix means that,
          in component form, we can reduce the <m>c_{ijkl}</m>'s down to just two
          independent scalar parameters, <m>\lambda</m> and <m>\mu</m>, and we have
          <men xml:id="eq-Newtonianstress">
            \sigma_{ij}=-p\delta_{ij}+\lambda\delta_{ij}\sum_{k=1}^3\pd{u_k}{x_k}

          </men>
          where <m>\lambda</m> is the <em>bulk viscosity</em> of the fluid and <m>\mu</m>
          is the <em>dynamic shear viscosity</em>. In vector form
          <me>
            \bsigma=-p\bI+\lambda\left(\nabla\cdot\bu\right)\bI+2\mu\be,
          </me>
          where <m>\be</m> is the rate-of-strain tensor, given by
          <me>\be=\left(\begin{matrix}
            e_{11}&amp;e_{12}&amp;e_{13}\\
            e_{21}&amp;e_{22}&amp;e_{23}\\

            \end{matrix}\right).
          </me>
          If the fluid is incompressible, then <m>\nabla\cdot\bu=0</m> and
          the bulk viscosity is undefined, meaning that <xref ref="eq-Newtonianstress"/>
          reduces to

                For an incompressible Newtonian fluid the stress tensor has only one parameter,
                the shear viscosity, <m>\mu</m>, and there are are only two parameters needed to
                describe the mechanical behaviour of the fluid: <m>\mu</m> and the fluid density, <m>\rho</m>.

                The shear viscosity, <m>\mu</m>, is often a function of temperature,
                and sometimes of pressure too. For most common fluids the shear viscosity
                decreases with increasing temperature.

      <title>Stress at a surface</title>
      <p>
        In <xref ref="def-stress-surface-calculation"/>, we stated formulae for the stress that a
        fluid exerts on a rigid solid boundary. We are now in a position to check the formulae given there.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <em>normal stress</em> on a surface with normal <m>\bn</m> is given by
        <men xml:id="eq-normalstress">
          \left(\bsigma\bn\right)\cdot\bn
          =-p+2\mu\bn\cdot\nabla\left(\bu\cdot\bn\right).
        </men>
        The last term represents <m>2\mu</m> times the derivative of the normal
        component of the velocity in the normal direction.
        Thus the normal stress is not necessary equal to the pressure!
      </p>
      <p>
        However, if we assume that the surface is <em>fixed</em> then we may show that
        the normal stress of an incompressible
        Newtonian fluid does equal the pressure:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              By rotating the coordinate axes we may assume that <m>\bn=\bi</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              From <xref ref="eq-normalstress"/>, the normal stress is <m>-p+2\mu\partial u/\partial x</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Since the fluid is incompressible,
              <me>
                \nabla\cdot\bu=\pd{u}{x}+\pd{v}{y}+\pd{w}{z}=0.
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The boundary conditions at the solid surface are <m>u=v=w=0</m>.
              Thus <me>\pd{v}{y}=\pd{w}{z}=0</me> on the surface.
              The continuity equation implies that <me>\pd{u}{x}=0</me> also.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Hence the normal stress on the surface is <m>-p</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        At a fixed solid surface the shear stress of a Newtonian fluid equals the viscosity
        multiplied by the derivative of the component of velocity parallel to the surface with
        respect to the perpendicular coordinate. We can show this as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              As before we may rotate the coordinate axes so that <m>\bn=\bi</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Using <xref ref="eq-cartesiannewtonianstress"/>, the stress at the surface is
              <me>\btau=\bsigma\bn
                =\left(\begin{matrix}
                -p+2\mu\pd{u}{x}\\
                \mu\left(\pd{u}{y}+\pd{v}{x}\right)\\
                \mu\left(\pd{u}{z}+\pd{w}{x}\right)
                \end{matrix}\right),
              </me>
              and the shear stresses are given by the <m>y</m>- and <m>z</m>-components:
              <me>
                \tau_y=\mu\left(\pd{u}{y}+\pd{v}{x}\right),\quad
                \tau_z=\mu\left(\pd{u}{z}+\pd{w}{x}\right).
              </me>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              No slip boundary conditions at the solid surface are <m>u=v=w=0</m>.
              Thus <me>\pd{u}{y}=\pd{u}{z}=0</me> on the surface.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Hence the shear stresses on the surface are
              <me>\tau_y=\mu\pd{v}{x}\quad\textrm{and}\quad\tau_z=\mu\pd{w}{x},</me>
              agreeing with the previous definitions.

        In previous chapters in this course,

        These are fluids with <m>\mu=0</m>.
        In this case, the constitutive law <xref ref="eq-cartesiannewtonianstress"/> becomes

      <title>Non-Newtonian fluids</title>
      <p>
        Many fluids do not obey the assumptions underlying a Newtonian fluid, meaning that their
        constitutive relationship takes a more complicated form.
        Many foods and household products, e.g. egg white, custard, shampoo, toothpaste have
        a <em>non-Newtonian</em> rheology.
        In the case of foods, this is often because the non-Newtonian properties themselves lend a texture
        that makes them taste better!
        For household products the non-Newtonian properties help us use them
        (for example a Newtonian shampoo might drain off our hair before we have a chance to work it in).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations do not work for genuinely non-Newtonian flows,
        and the pressure and viscous terms must be replaced by a formula that captures the rheology.
        However, for a surprising variety of complex fluids,
        the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations do in fact provide a remarkably good description of the behaviour.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, however, the rheology of non-Newtonian fluids is often very complex,
        and is an area of active research.
        Categories include the following:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Non-constant viscosity:</em>
              This is perhaps the simplest way a fluid can be non-Newtonian.
              Examples include shear thinning fluids, e.g. blood,
              and shear-thickening fluids, e.g. fluids containing cornflour such as custard,
              or fluids whose viscosity depends on the temperature of the fluid.

              <em>Viscoelastic fluids:</em>
              These are fluids that have both elastic and viscous properties,
              that is the molecules seem to have a memory and spring back when they are
              suddenly displaced (but not so much when they are slowly displaced);
              thus they are sometimes described as having a `fading memory'.
              In this case the formula for the deviatoric part of the stress
              tensor involves an integral over the previous states of the fluid.
              Examples include ketchup, paint, mucus and vitreous humour.

              <em>Anisotropic fluids:</em> Some fluids respond differently to the same stress
              but applied in different directions.
              An example of this is blood, which
              contains red blood cells affecting the dynamics. When the blood is flowing the cells align,
              meaning the effective viscosity is much less in the direction of flow and
              more in the transverse direction (this is also related to the fact that blood is shear thinning).
              In large arteries it is usually acceptable to model blood as a Newtonian fluid
              because the diameter of the artery is many times that of the cells.
              However, for small arteries, such as that in <xref ref="fig-artery"/>,
              the Newtonian model does not give an accurate picture.

        We consider the balance of linear momentum
        in a small cube of side length <m>\delta</m> for an <em>incompressible fluid</em>,
        see <xref ref="fig-small-cube"/>.
        To do this we employ the Reynolds Transport Theorem <xref ref="eqn-RTT"/>,
        with <m>\bf(\bx,t)</m> equal to the linear momentum of the fluid per unit volume,
        <m>\bf=\rho\bu</m>, and <m>V(t)</m> being the small volume of fluid under consideration,
        which coincides with the cube at time <m>t</m> (however, note that the volume of fluid
        we are following is not generally a cube at other times). Substituting
        <m>\bf=\rho\bu</m>, the theorem states that:

          \dd{}{t} \iiint_{V(t)} \rho\bu \, \de{x} \, \de{y} \, \de{z} = \iiint_{V(t)} \left[

        We note that <m>\iiint_{V(t)} \rho\bu \, \de{x} \, \de{y} \, \de{z}</m> is the integral of the
        linear momentum per unit volume over the volume and is therefore the total momentum
        of the fluid particles in <m>V(t)</m>. The left-hand side of this equation is thus
        the Lagrangian rate of change of momentum of these fluid particles.
        By Newton's second law, this must equal the resultant force acting on the fluid
        in <m>V(t)</m>, which we denote by <m>\bF</m>. This force is the sum of different contributions, which
        can be categorised into <em>body forces</em> (which act on the whole volume of fluid)
        and <em>surface forces</em> (acting only on the surface of the fluid, and which arise from the fluid stress):

        <title>Clarification on the detail of the proof</title>
        <p>
          Note that there was some sleight of hand going on in this proof!
          We assumed that the stress was uniform over each face of the cube,
          meaning we could just multiply the stress on each face by the
          area of the face to get the force on that face.
          Indeed, if this were actually the case, then the stress would be uniform
          over the whole surface of the cube, and hence the net force on the surface would be zero.
          To resolve this, we would need to add higher-order contributions into the integrand
          when calculating the force on each face, which could result in higher-order contributions
          to the resultant force due to the sum of the stresses. We could do this by writing the stress as a Taylor series about the corner of the cube.
          Happily, with a bit more work (not included here), these higher order
          terms cancel and the result we obtained here holds.

        <title>Solving the equations</title>
        <p>
          The Navier<ndash/>Stokes equation is notoriously difficult to solve, particularly as the term
          <me>\rho\bu\cdot\nabla\bu</me> is nonlinear.
          In fact, one of the famous
          <url href="https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/">Millennium Prize Problems</url>
          is to prove that in three dimensions,
          given suitable initial and boundary conditions,
          there always exists a smooth solution of the
          Navier<ndash/>Stokes equation for all time,
          or to provide an example where this does not hold.
          The problem is that the nonlinear term can lead to singularities developing
          in the solution, which would correspond to infinite velocities or pressures
          at some point in the fluid.
          This is not expected to happen in real fluids,
          but proving this rigorously is a major challenge.

          You will be relieved to know that in this course we will only consider

          as we did in the derivation of the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equation
          <xref ref="eqn-navierstokes"/>, we can instead work in terms of a general stress
          tensor to derive the Cauchy equation, which applies to any fluid. This states
          <men xml:id="eqn-cauchy-equation">
            \rho\DD{\bu}{t}=\nabla\cdot\bsigma+\rho\bf,
          </men>
          where <m>\bf</m> is the body force per unit mass (for example, gravity).
          This is a more general equation than the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equation,
          which applies only to Newtonian fluids obeying the consititutive law
          <xref ref="eq-cartesiannewtonianstress"/>.
          You will perform the derivation in this more general case in
          <xref ref="ps-Cauchy-equation"/>.

          Note that the vector calculus operators in cylindrical (and also in spherical)
          coordinates are quite complicated.
          I would always recommend looking up the formulae,
          because they is very tricky to remember and extremely time-consuming to derive.
          A helpful website that lists these formulae along with many other useful formulae is
          <url href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Del_in_cylindrical_and_spherical_coordinates">here</url>,
          and <xref ref="ref-acheson"/> gives these formulae in the appendices,
          as do many other textbooks.
          Note in particular that the Laplacian of a vector quantity
          is not given by the Laplacians of its components individually.

            Since we have found an expression for the pressure that satisfies
            all three components of the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations,
            we can say that the given flow does satisfy the equations.

      </example>
      <remark>
        <p>
          Note that in general if we have an expression for <m>\nabla p</m>,
          say we know that <m>\nabla p={\bq}</m>, then we can check whether or not
          it it is possible to find <m>p</m> by taking the curl of both sides,
          i.e. <m>\nabla\times{\bq}=\nabla\times\nabla p=0</m>
          (since <m>\nabla\times\nabla f=0</m> for all functions <m>f</m>).
          If <m>{\bq}</m> satisfies <m>\nabla\times{\bq}=0</m> then
          it is possible to find a pressure field (and hence the Navier<ndash/>Stokes
          equations are satisfied), otherwise it is not.  In this example

            \nabla p=-\rho K^2x\bi-\rho K^2y\bj

            -(4\rho K^2z+\rho g)\bk\right)=0,

          It is quite possible for a flow not to satisfy the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations.
          For example, the similar looking flow
          <men xml:id="eq-altflow">
            \bu=K(x+y)\bi+Ky\bj-2Kz\bk,
          </men>
          does satisfy the continuity equation, but has
          <me>
            \bu\cdot\nabla\bu=K^2(x+2y)\bi+K^2y\bj+4K^2z\bk.
          </me>
          The Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations would give
          <me>
            \nabla p=-\left(-\rho K^2(x+2y),-\rho K^2y,-4\rho K^2z-\rho g\right).
          </me>
          Trying to solve this from the first equation would give
          <me>
            p=-\frac12\rho K^2(x^2+4xy)+f_1(y,z),
          </me>
          and substituting this solution into the second equation gives
          <me>
            -2\rho K^2x+\pd{f_1}{y}=-\rho K^2y\quad\Rightarrow\quad
            \pd{f_1}{y}=2\rho K^2x-\rho K^2y.
          </me>
          This is a contradiction as <m>f_1</m> is supposed to be a function of <m>y</m> and <m>z</m> only,
          but here the right-hand side depends on <m>x</m>, meaning that <m>f_1</m> has to depend on <m>x</m>.
          Alternatively we could show that the curl of <m>\nabla p</m> is non-zero,
          which also implies a contradiction.

        We can also use the Reynolds Transport Theorem to perform

      <title>Methods of solution</title>
      <p>
        For real problems, it is notoriously difficult to solve the
        Navier<ndash/>Stokes <xref ref="eqn-navierstokes"/> and
        continuity <xref ref="eqn-incompressibledef"/> equations.
        Many researchers spend their entire careers analysing and solving these very equations!
        In practical terms, a variety of analytical and numerical techniques
        must be employed, and usually we only get an approximate solution.
        In this course we are only looking at analytical approaches,
        but you should be aware that there are many different approaches possible,
        and we describe a few in the following:
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              A few problems in fluid mechanics have analytical solutions,
              meaning they can be solved exactly.
              For example the solution for Poiseuille flow in a pipe is exact,
              and has proved to be an excellent description of steady flow in a pipe,
              even in realistic, imperfect conditions.            
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Other problems can be solved in the form of an infinite series.
              An example of this is boundary layer theory or lubrication theory,
              in which we choose a small parameter <m>\epsilon\ll1</m>
              (which is a dimensionless quantity with a physical meaning).
              For example, it could be that two lengthscales in the problem
              are very different from one another, and we choose <m>\epsilon</m>
              equal to the smaller lengthscale divided by the large one.
              We write the solution as an infinite series of terms, for example
              <md>
                <mrow>
                  \bu=&amp;\bu_0+\epsilon\bu_1+\epsilon^2\bu_2+\epsilon^3\bu_3+\dots,
                </mrow>
                <mrow>
                  p=&amp;p_0+\epsilon p_1+\epsilon^2p_2+\epsilon^3p_3+\dots,
                </mrow>
              </md>
              where the dots indicate terms multiplied by higher powers of
              <m>\epsilon</m> (that is, smaller terms).
              Examples include:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    flow in a curved pipe for small Dean numbers
                    (proportional to the Reynolds number times the square root of the
                    curvature of the pipe),
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    flow of a thin film of fluid.
                    We take <m>\epsilon</m> equal to a typical film thickness divided
                    by a typical lengthscale tangential to the film.
                    Often, it is sufficient to compute only the leading nontrivial terms in the series,
                    and the equations governing these terms represent a hugh simplification over the
                    Navier<ndash/>Stokes and continuity equations.
                    Whilst the resulting equations generally need to be solved numerically,
                    the spatial dimension of the problem is reduced by one for such flows,
                    and this is a huge saving
                    of computational time.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Other problems can be solved approximately
              by neglecting terms that are known to be small.
              An example of this is high-Reynolds-number flow when we can solve the Euler equations
              and low-Reynolds-number flow when we can solve the Stokes equations
              instead of the full Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations.
              Flow in a porous medium (such as flow of water through soil,
              oil through porous rocks or tissue fluid between cells in the body)
              is a different type of approximation in which we only consider average flow variables.
              This approximation is a simplification of the solution in the form of an
              infinite series, and effectively,
              we are just finding the first term of the infinite series,
              that is we are finding <m>\bu_0</m> and <m>p_0</m> from
              the series solutions given above.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In many cases, we cannot solve the equations analytically,
              but we can find a solution by simulating them on a computer.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In other cases we need to simplify the equations somewhat
              to solve them on a computer.
              An example is if there are sharp boundary layers,
              which need fine resolution for the solution to be found there.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Finally, one can use an experimental approach,
              either by building a scale model,
              which should have dimensionless parameters such as the Reynolds number
              the same as the original,
              or by taking measurements on the original system.
              The big advantage is that,
              as long as the experiment is correctly performed,
              the flows should be realistic of the system being studied,
              but the disadvantages are that it is often hard to perform
              measurements of flow and pressure with sufficient accuracy or resolution.

      <title>Methods to solve the equations analytically</title>
      <p>
        We start by looking at the special cases in which we can
        solve the equations analytically.
        In these cases, we typically first make some simplifying assumptions.
        Note that for these types of problems,
        we are only trying to find a solution that works
        (proving the uniqueness of the solutions we find is a much harder thing
        to do <ndash/> i.e. it is hard to prove that the solution we found is
        the only one).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Stability:</em>
        Whether or not a given solution that we find is stable is a crucial question,
        because if it is not stable then it would not be seen in an experiment.
        To determine stability mathematically we would need to use techniques
        such as those taught in the course MA40045 Dynamical Systems.
        However, it is typically very difficult to do this in practice
        in the study of fluid dynamics because of the (infinite) dimensionality
        of the phase space.
        The methods we use in this course to find exact solutions
        <ndash/> that is, making assumptions and finding a solution to the equations
        <ndash/> get us a solution, but don't know whether or not it is stable.
        A practical way of determining stability is to perform an experiment
        or numerical simulation (which is sometimes called a numerical experiment)
        <ndash/> an unstable solution would not be able to be found this way,
        but these methods can be difficult if it is only very weakly unstable.
        Plus part of the reason for finding analytical solutions is to avoid
        having to do experiments or numerics,
        which are often much more time-consuming and difficult!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Simplifying a problem by making assumptions:</em>
        When considering a problem that involves solving the Navier<ndash/>Stokes
        and continuity equations,
        we often make one or more (in fact as many as possible!)
        of the following simplifying assumptions:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Two-dimensional flow (in <m>(x,y)</m>-plane):</em>
              <m>\partial u/\partial z=\partial v/\partial z
                =\partial w/\partial z=\partial p/\partial z=0</m>
              (indeed <m>\partial/\partial z=0</m> for any variable)
              and <m>w=0</m>.
              Of course, this can be generalised to two-dimensional flow in the
              <m>(x,z)</m>- or <m>(y,z)</m>-planes and also two-dimensional flow
              in the <m>(r,\theta)</m>-directions in cylindrical polar coordinates.
              For example we may do a lab experiment between closely separated
              parallel plates to ensure that the flow is approximately two-dimensional
              (Hele<ndash/>Shaw cell).

              For example,

              can be seen as waves that travel around the body with a characteristic wave speed
              (that is different from the blood velocity).

        Most of these are assumptions on the <em>geometry</em> and
        <em>spatial symmetries</em> of the problem, but the assumptions of
        steady flow, fully developed flow and
        periodic and sinusoidal flow are different.
        The trick is to look carefully at the problem,
        and think which (if any) of the above assumptions might be reasonable.
        We can try making them, and then check that the problem is still consistent.
        If it is consistent that is fine,
        but if not it means that the assumption was wrong.

    <title>Examples of solutions to the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations</title>
    <p>
      There is a remarkably small number of types of exact solutions
      to the Navier<ndash/>Stokes <xref ref="eqn-navierstokes"/> and
      continuity <xref ref="eqn-incompressibledef"/> equations.
      A particular reason for this is the nonlinear term <m>\bu\cdot\bnabla\bu</m>,
      which makes it difficult to find mathematically exact solutions, and indeed,
      many of the known exact solutions have <m>\bu\cdot\bnabla\bu=\bzero</m>,
      thus removing the problem of the nonlinear term.
      In this section, we present a few of the more well known exact solutions.
      <em>N.B.</em> In all of the examples in this section we neglect gravity.

    <example xml:id="subsec-shear-flow">
      <title>Shear flow</title>
      <p>
        Shear flow often occurs near a rigid flat surface, and has the following properties:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The flow is unidirectional and parallel to the surface.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The flow speed increases linearly as we move away from the surface.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        For example if the surface is the plane <m>y=0</m>,
        then the flow <m>\bu=(ky,0,0)</m> is a shear flow,
        where <m>k</m> is constant, see <xref ref="fig-shear-flow"/>.

      </figure>
      <p>
        To check this is a solution of the Navier<ndash/>Stokes and continuity equations,
        we substitute in the expressions.
        The continuity equation <xref ref="eqn-incompressibledef"/> is readily satisfied,
        whilst the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations <xref ref="eqn-navierstokes"/> give
        <me>
          0=-\pd{p}{x},\quad0=-\pd{p}{y},\quad0=-\pd{p}{z},

      <p>
        For a Newtonian fluid contained between parallel plates moving tangentially,
        we obtain a shear flow in the gap.
        The velocity varies linearly across the gap and matches the plate velocity
        at each of the two plates.
        This is called <em>Couette flow</em> and it is an exact solution of the
        Navier<ndash/>Stokes and continuity equations:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\rho\partial\bu/\partial t</m>: The flow is steady so this term is zero.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>\rho\bu\cdot\nabla\bu</m>: Since <m>\bu</m> is directed tangential to the plates,
              <m>\bu\cdot\nabla</m> is a derivative in the tangential direction;
              however, <m>\bu</m> varies only in the direction normal to the plates.
              Therefore, <m>\bu\cdot\nabla\bu</m> is zero for this flow.

          <li>
            <p>

          <li>
            <p>

        Poiseuille flow is the characteristic flow seen when an incompressible Newtonian

        its diameter.

        three coordinate directions, i.e. <m>\bu=u\hat{\br}+v\hat{\btheta}+w\hat{\bz}</m>,
        and assume a no-slip boundary condition at the pipe wall:

        We also assume that the flow is steady, is axisymmetric, has no swirl
        (i.e.no azimuthal flow), is fully-developed, and we neglect gravity.

        We require <m>A=0</m> for regularity of the solution at <m>r=0</m>,

        Therefore the fluid velocity in Poiseuille flow is given by

        We now consider two generalisations:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Womersley flow:</em>
              This is pipe flow driven by an axial pressure drop along the pipe
              that oscillates sinusoidally in time
              (Poiseuille flow was driven by a constant pressure gradient).
              Unlike Poiseuille flow,
              the exact profile of the flow depends on a parameter called
              the Womersley parameter (which depends on the frequency).
              <xref ref="fig-womersley-flow"/> shows an example.
              The flow is:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Unidirectional axial flow (purely along the pipe)
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Axisymmetric
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>
                    Flow direction oscillates in time.
                    Sometimes the flow goes in both directions at once,
                    which can be seen in <xref ref="fig-womersley-flow"/>.
                  </p>
                </li>
              </ul>
              If we add the velocity field of Poiseuille flow <xref ref="eq-poiseuille-flow-profile"/>
              onto the Womersley flow velocity field,
              we obtain the flow that would be driven by a pressure gradient that oscillates
              about a non-zero mean.
              Flow profiles of this sort can be seen in blood flow,
              since the beating of the heart provides a pressure gradient
              that can be approximated by a constant plus sinusoidally varying component.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <em>Dean flow:</em>
              This is a steady flow driven by a steady prescribed pressure drop along the pipe,
              but the pipe is curved, see <xref ref="fig-dean-flow"/>.
              Within the pipe the flow is predominantly in the axial direction,
              but the centrifugal force due to the curvature drives a secondary flow
              across the centre of the pipe towards the outside of the bend,
              and then back around the walls of the pipe towards the inside of the bend.
              This secondary flow forms Dean vortices.
              This is thought to provide a possible explanation as to why the disease
              atherosclerosis in arteries is more common on the inside of bends in arteries,
              since the cells lining the artery walls are more healthy in conditions of high stress.
              <xref ref="fig-dean-flow"/> shows shows the secondary flow in the transverse cross section,
              which are termed <em>Dean vortices</em>.

          In this question you will investigate the flow field generated next to

          of density <m>\rho</m> and kinematic viscosity <m>\nu</m> in <m>y>0</m>,
          and that the plate oscillates purely in the <m>x</m>-direction with displacement
          <m>A\cos\omega t\,\bi</m> at time <m>t</m>,
          as shown in <xref ref="fig-stokes-boundary-layer-setup"/>.
          You may also assume that the plate and volume of fluid are
          large enough that you can neglect their boundaries
          (that is, the plate occupies the whole plane <m>y=0</m> and the fluid occupies
          the whole of <m>y>0</m>)
          and that the plate has been oscillating long enough so that the whole fluid
          is oscillating periodically.

            We assume this is a two-dimensional flow,

            In addition we assume the velocity components do not depend on <m>x</m>
            (because translating the problem in the <m>x</m>-direction is the same problem).
            Thus we have <m>u(y,t)</m>, <m>v(y,t)</m>, <m>w=0</m> and <m>p(y,t)</m>.

            Hence <m>v</m> is constant, and the boundary condition <m>v=0</m> at <m>y=0</m>

    <p>
      The calculation shows that the drag force experienced by an object moving
      through a fluid at low Reynolds numbers can be derived from the Stokes equations.
      This analysis shows that the Stokes drag on a sphere is <m>6\pi\mu Ua</m>
      in the direction opposing motion, which holds as long as <m>\rho Ua/\mu\ll1</m>.
      This is a famous classical result in fluid mechanics.
    </p>
    <p>
      This principle is used in a falling ball viscometer in which a small spherical ball
      of known radius <m>a</m> and mass <m>m</m> is dropped into a fluid,
      whose viscosity <m>\mu</m> we wish to measure.
      Once the ball has reached its terminal falling velocity <m>U</m>,
      the forces on it must be in equilibrium,
      meaning that the force of gravity balances the drag force.
      Assuming the sphere is small enough and going slowly enough and the fluid is
      viscous enough that the flow has a low Reynolds number,
      the drag is given by <m>6\pi\mu Ua</m> and the force of gravity is <m>mg</m>,
      where <m>g</m> is the acceleration due to gravity. Thus
      <me>
        \mu=\frac{mg}{6\pi Ua},
      </me>
      and so measuring the terminal velocity and substituting into this equation
      gives an estimate of the viscosity of the fluid.
    </p>
    <p>
      We assume the flow is axisymmetric and work in a moving reference frame
      centred on the sphere using spherical coordinates.
      As shown in <xref ref="subsec-stokes-streamfunction"/>, we can write the velocity
      in terms of a Stokes streamfunction <m>\Psi</m> using

      At low Reynolds numbers, we take the curl of the Stokes equation

      <me>
        \nabla^2\bomega=\bzero,

      and, after some work, we may show this is equivalent to

            Using the expressions for the velocity components

            Adding a constant onto the streamfunction does not affect the velocity,

      which is the total force of the fluid on the sphere,
      retarding the motion.
      Since the stress is the force per unit area on the sphere,
      the drag equals the integral of the stress over the surface.
      We find the stress using

      On substituting in the expressions for the velocity components

        \btau

        =-p_0\hat\br+\frac{3\mu U}{2a}\left(\sin\theta\hat\btheta-\cos\theta\hat\br\right).\label{eq:tauworking}
      </me>
      We express the bracket <m>(\sin\theta\hat\btheta-\cos\theta\hat\br)</m>
      in this equation in terms of Cartesian coordinates, using the conversion formulae
      <me>
        \hat\br=\cos\phi\sin\theta\bI+\sin\phi\sin\theta\bj+\cos\theta\bk,\quad
        \hat\btheta=\cos\phi\cos\theta\bI+\sin\phi\cos\theta\bj-\sin\theta\bk.

      Substituting this into the expression for <m>\btau</m>, we obtain the stress
      <me>
        \btau=-p_0\hat\br-\frac{3\mu U}{2a}\bk.
      </me>
      The drag equals the integral of <m>\btau</m> over the surface of the sphere.
      The integral of the term <m>-p_0\hat\br</m> is zero because this force cancels
      on opposite sides of the sphere, but the term <m>-\frac{3\mu U}{2a}\hat\bk</m>
      is always in the same direction;
      thus the total drag force is this term times the area, which is
      <me>
        \left(-\frac{3\mu U}{2a}\hat\bk\right)\times\left(4\pi a^2\right)=-6\pi\mu Ua\hat\bk.
      </me>
      Thus the drag force is <m>\boxed{6\pi\mu Ua}</m> in the direction opposing motion.
      This is called the <em>Stokes drag</em> and it is a famous result in fluid mechanics.

        This derivation is extremely complicated in terms of the algebra,
        and you would certainly not be asked to reproduce something so long-winded
        as this in this course.
        However, you should understand the concepts, and be able to follow the general argument.
        In fact the mathematics presented here is very elegant indeed,
        and it is amazing that an exact solution exists and can be calculated.
      </p>

    <remark>
      <p>
        Notice that in the course of the derivation <xref ref="eq-separablePsi"/>,
        we made the assumption that <m>\Psi</m> is separable.
        Thus we have not rigorously shown that the solution we found was unique,
        that is there might be other solutions to this problem that satisfy
        the boundary conditions at <m>r=a</m> and the condition as
        <m>r\rightarrow\infty</m>.

    <example xml:id="example-womersley-flow">
      <title>Womersley flow (non-examinable)</title>
      <p>
        <em>This section is non-examinable.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Womersley flow occurs in pipes in which there is an imposed oscillating pressure gradient.
        Characteristics of this flow are often seen in blood flow in arteries,
        since the flow and pressure gradient are unsteady.
        As for the derivation of Poiseuille flow, we consider a long,
        circular cylindrical pipe of radius <m>a</m>,
        and work in cylindrical polar coordinates centred on the axis of the pipe.
        We make the following assumptions:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              The flow is <em>fully developed</em>; thus <m>\partial\bu/\partial z=0</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The flow is <em>axisymmetric</em>;
              thus <m>\partial\bu/\partial\theta=\partial p/\partial\theta=0</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The flow has a <em>symmetry</em> in a diameter of the cross-section.
              In turn this means there is no swirl in the flow, and thus <m>u_\theta=0</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        The derivation proceed similarly to that of Poiseuille flow
        (so we cover it quite briefly here).
        With the assumptions, the continuity equation reduces to
        <me>
          \frac1r\pd{}{r}\left(ru_r\right)=0,
        </me>
        which gives <m>u_r\propto1/r</m>,
        whereupon the boundary condition implies that the constant of proportionality is zero,
        and hence <m>u_r=0</m>.
        Thus the only flow component is the axial flow, <m>u_z</m>,
        which, according to the assumptions, is a function of <m>r</m> and <m>t</m> only
        (and does not depend on either <m>\theta</m> or <m>z</m>).
        The radial and azimuthal components of the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equation reduce to the
        equations
        <me>
          \pd{p}{r}=\pd{p}{\theta}=0,
        </me>
        and thus <m>p</m> is a function of <m>z</m> and <m>t</m> only.
        The axial component of the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equation is
        <men xml:id="eq-axialNS">
          \rho\pd{u_z}{t}=-\pd{p}{z}+\mu\frac1r\pd{}{r}\left(r\pd{u_z}{r}\right).
        </men>
        Consider what happens to the three terms in this equation at
        fixed values of <m>t</m> and <m>r</m> as <m>z</m> alone is varied.
        Since <m>u_z</m> is not a function of <m>z</m>,
        the only term that can vary is <m>\pd{p}{z}</m>,
        while the other two terms stay constant.
        Since equality must be maintained this shows that, in fact,
        <m>\pd{p}{z}</m> must be fixed as <m>z</m> varies,
        and thus <m>p=A(t)z+B(t)</m>, where <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are unknown functions of time.
        We set <m>G(t)=-A(t)</m> to be the pressure gradient of the flow at time <m>t</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Poiseuille flow <m>G</m> is fixed in time, but in Womersley flow we set
        <m>G(t)=G_0\cos\omega t</m>, where <m>G_0</m> is constant
        (by fixing the origin of time we may fix <m>G_0</m> to be real and positive).
        We can write this as
        <me>
          G(t)=\frac{G_0}{2}e^{\im\omega t}+\mathrm{c.c.},
        </me>
        where <m>\mathrm{c.c.}</m> denotes the complex conjugate.
        We try a solution of the form

        This equation must be true for all values of <m>t</m>,
        which means that both of the expressions in brackets <m>\{\}</m> must be be zero.
        Since the two bracketed expressions are complex conjugates of one another,
        we only need to consider the first bracket. Thus

        This is a linear, second-order, non-constant-coefficient,

        We can therefore solve it as a complementary function <m>U_{cf}</m>
        plus a particular integral <m>U_{pi}</m>.
        The particular integral is given by

        To find the complementary function we must solve

        </me>
        and substituting <m>s=(\sqrt{-\im\omega/\nu})r</m> and simplifying,
        we remove the coefficients on the left-hand side to obtain

          \dd{^2U_{cf}}{s^2}+\frac1s\dd{U_{cf}}{s}+U_{cf}=0.

              means that <m>U</m> must also be zero at <m>r=a</m>.

        This is Womersley flow, which was first described by Womersley in 1955.
        The nondimensionalised flow profile is

        This nondimensionalisation shows that the flow is characterised by a single parameter,
        the Womersley number, <m>\alpha</m>
        (as opposed to 4 dimensional parameters: <m>\rho</m>, <m>\mu</m>, <m>a</m> and <m>\omega</m>).

          which is a Poiseuille flow profile (multiplied by an oscillating amplitude).
          This flow is called <em>quasi-steady</em>,
          because this is the solution that we would obtain if we neglected the
          time-derivative term in the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equation.

          For large Womersley numbers we use the standard asymptotic expansions for the
          Bessel function, which is:
          <me>
            J_0(z)\approx\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi z}}\cos\left(z-\frac{\pi}{4}\right)
          </me>
          when <m>|z|\gg1</m>. Letting <m>z=x+\im y</m>, where <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are real,
          we can expand the cosine function:
          <me>
            J_0(z)\approx\sqrt{\frac{1}{2\pi z}}\left(e^{\im x-\im\pi/4}e^{-y}+e^{-\im x+\im\pi/4}e^{y}\right)
            \approx\sqrt{\frac{1}{2\pi z}}e^{\im x-\im\pi/4}e^{-y}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{2\pi z}}e^{\im z-\im\pi/4}.
          </me>
          where the second approximation is valid if <m>y\ll0</m> (which is the case we have).
          Substituting into <xref ref="eq-womsersley-flow"/>, we obtain
          <md>
            <mrow>
              u_z\approx&amp;-\frac{\im G_0}{2\omega\rho}\left(1-\sqrt{\frac{a}{r}}e^{-\sqrt{\im}\alpha(1-r/a)}\right)e^{\im\omega t}+\mathrm{c.c.}
            </mrow>
            <mrow>
              =&amp;-\frac{\im G_0}{2\omega\rho}\left(1-\sqrt{\frac{a}{r}}e^{-\frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{2}}(1-\frac{r}{a})}e^{-\im\frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{2}}(1-\frac{r}{a})}\right)e^{\im\omega t}+\mathrm{c.c.}
            </mrow>
          </md>
          Away from the boundaries, <m>\frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{2}}(1-\frac{r}{a})</m> is large
          and so the exponential terms in the bracket in this expression are very small, and
          <me>
            u_z\approx-\frac{\im G_0}{2\omega\rho}e^{\im\omega t}+\mathrm{c.c.}
            =\frac{G_0}{\omega\rho}\sin\omega t.
          </me>
          This type of flow is called <em>plug flow</em>,
          since at any fixed time the profile is uniform across the interior.
        </p>
        <p>
          Near the walls of the pipe the exponential terms become important.
          At the walls themselves, the flow is zero, and, as we move away,
          the expression for the velocity shows there are rapid oscillations
          that decrease in magnitude as we move away from the wall.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus we see that the flow is divided into two distinct regions.
          There is the core in which the dominant balance is between the pressure gradient
          and the inertial term (the time-derivative term),
          and in which the viscosity plays a minor role.
          Sometimes this is termed an <em>inviscid core</em>.
          The other region is the boundary layer,
          in which the viscosity is important.
          The width of the boundary layer is of the order of magnitude <m>\alpha^{-1}a</m>
          (often we would just say loosely that the boundary layer has width <m>\alpha^{-1}a</m>).
          Within a few <m>\alpha^{-1}a</m>'s away from the boundary,
          the flow is affected by the presence of the boundary,
          but further away the effect is negligible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another way that we could find the flow for large Womersley number is
          to use boundary layer analysis in the boundary,
          and an inviscid flow method (such as potential flow analysis) in the interior,
          and match the two solutions at the edge of the boundary layer.
          Since we have the exact solution valid for all Womersley numbers,
          this method of separating into the boundary layer and core regions is not necessary
          to find the solution.
          However, in many problems, no solution can be found in the general case,
          but a solution can be found in the particular case when one parameter is large or small.
          It is surprising how often such solutions are possible in real world problems,
          and this method often provides significant insight into the problem.

      <title>Nondimensionalisation</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          <em>Based on Problem 2.2 in <xref ref="ref-acheson"/></em>
        </p>
        <p>
          In this problem you will work through the nondimensionalisation of
          a typical fluid flow problem to identify the Reynolds number as a key
          dimensionless parameter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Consider the two-dimensional steady flow of a viscous incompressible fluid
          past a circular cylinder of radius <m>a</m>.
          Far from the cylinder, the fluid velocity is uniform with magnitude <m>U</m>
          in the <m>x</m>-direction.
          The governing equations are the incompressible Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations
          and continuity equation:
          <me>
            \left(\bu\cdot\nabla\right)\bu=-\frac{1}{\rho}\nabla p+\nu\nabla^2\bu,\quad
            \nabla\cdot\bu=0,
          </me>
          where <m>\bu=(u,v)</m> is the velocity field, <m>p</m> is the pressure field,
          <m>\rho</m> is the fluid density,
          and <m>\nu</m> is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Write down suitable boundary conditions at the cylinder surface
            and far from the cylinder.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            At the cylinder surface, we have the no-slip and no-penetration
            boundary conditions:
            <me>
              u=v=0.
            </me>
            Far from the cylinder, the velocity approaches the uniform flow:
            <me>
              u\rightarrow U,\quad v\rightarrow0\quad\textrm{as }\sqrt{x^2+y^2}\rightarrow\infty.
            </me>

        </solution>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Introduce nondimensional variables
            <me>
              x^*=\frac{x}{a},\quad y^*=\frac{y}{a},\quad
              u^*=\frac{u}{U},\quad v^*=\frac{v}{U},\quad
              p^*=\frac{p}{\rho U^2}.
            </me>
            Rewrite the governing equations and boundary conditions in terms of
            these nondimensional variables.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We have:
            <me>
              \frac{U^2}{L}\left(\bu^*\cdot\nabla^*\right)\bu^*
              =-\frac{U^2}{L}\nabla^*p^*
              +\frac{\nu U}{L^2}\nabla^{*2}\bu^*,\quad
              \frac{U}{L}\nabla^*\cdot\bu^*=0,
            </me>
            which simplify to
            <me>
              \mathrm{Re}\left(\bu^*\cdot\nabla^*\right)\bu^*
              =-\mathrm{Re}\nabla^*p^*
              +\nabla^{*2}\bu^*,\quad
              \nabla^*\cdot\bu^*=0,
            </me>
            while the boundary conditions become:
            <me>
              u^*=v^*=0
            </me>
            at <m>x^{*2}+y^{*2}=1</m> and
            <me>
              u^*\rightarrow 1,\quad v^*\rightarrow0\quad\textrm{as }\sqrt{x^{*2}+y^{*2}}\rightarrow\infty.
            </me>
          </p>
        </solution>
      </task>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            You should have found that the nondimensional problem depends
            only on a single parameter: the Reynolds number.
            Thus flows at equal Reynolds numbers are geometrically similar,
            and one only needs to know the Reynolds number to understand the
            flow.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was a particularly simple problem
            that has an unambiguous length and velocity scale,
            and so nondimensionalisation of the problem works particularly well.
            However, it is frequently helpful to nondimensionalise problems before
            solving so that key dimensionless groups of parameters
            (such as the Reynolds number) can be identified.

      <title>Falling ball viscometer</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          For slowly moving spheres, the resistive force is given by Stokes
          drag, and equals <m>3\pi\mu Du</m>, where <m>D</m> is the diameter of the sphere, <m>\mu</m>
          is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, and <m>u</m> is the speed of the sphere
          (this is a famous result).
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Check the dimensions of the Stokes drag. Is the dimension what you expect?
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The dimensions of the terms are as follows:
            <me>
              [3\pi]=1,\quad
              [\mu]=ML^{-1}T^{-1},\quad
              [D]=L,\quad
              [u]=LT^{-1},

            meaning that
            <me>
              \left[3\pi\mu Du\right]=1\times ML^{-1}T^{-1}\times L\times LT^{-1}
              =MLT^{-2}.
            </me>
            Thus the expression <m>3\pi\mu Du</m> for the Stokes drag

          <p>
            We have

            </me>
            for which the integrating factor is <m>e^{\frac{3\pi\mu D}{m}t}</m>, and

              ue^{\frac{3\pi\mu D}{m}t}=\int ge^{\frac{3\pi\mu D}{m}t}dt

            where <m>c</m> is a constant of integration. Hence

              u=\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}+ce^{-\frac{3\pi\mu D}{m}t}
            </me>
            The initial condition is <m>u=0</m> at <m>t=0</m>, and,

            We substitute <m>u_t=\frac{mg}{3\pi\mu D}</m> and <m>\tau=\frac{m}{3\pi\mu D}</m>.

            The physical significance of these choices is that <m>u_t</m>
            is the terminal velocity of the sphere and <m>\tau</m> is the timescale over
            which the velocity of the sphere approaches the terminal velocity.
            Every <m>\tau</m> units of time, the velocity of the sphere becomes closer

            The ball would attain its terminal velocity very quickly (in much less than a second),
            and since <m>u_t</m> is on order of centimetres per second, a container of about 10 cm
            deep would be suitable for measurement. In fact this idea is commonly used to measure
            the viscosity of fluids (since the viscosity can be calculated from the terminal velocity);
            this is called a <em>falling ball viscometer</em>.

      <introduction>
        <p>
          In this problem, you will calculate the resultant force on the cube shown in
          <xref ref="fig-small-cube"/> due to the pressure in the surrounding fluid acting on the fluid
          within the cube.
          We will consider two different methods of calculating this force.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that, in this question, as with the derivation of the
          Navier<ndash/>Stokes equations <xref ref="eqn-navierstokes"/>,
          you may use some sleight of hand, so as to avoid carefully integrating
          the force over the surface.
          However, as in that case, fortunately the errors cancel and the result is correct.

            Assuming that the pressure <m>p(x,y,z)</m> is uniform over the surface
            <m>x=x_0</m> and over the surface <m>x=x_0+\delta</m>,
            calculate the force on the fluid in the cube due to the pressure of the
            surrounding fluid on these two faces and show that it is approximately
            <me>-\delta^3\pd{p}{x}\bi=-V\pd{p}{x}\bi,</me>
            where <m>V=\delta^3</m> is the volume of the cube.

        <solution>
          <p>
            The force on <m>x=x_0</m> is pressure times area acting into the cube,

            equals <m>-\delta^2p|_{x+\delta}\bi</m>.

            Similarly, calculate the force on the fluid in the cube due to the pressure of the
            surrounding fluid on the faces <m>y=y_0</m> and <m>y=y_0+\delta</m>,
            and on the faces <m>z=z_0</m> and <m>z=z_0+\delta</m>.
            Hence show that the total force on the fluid in the cube due to the pressure
            of the surrounding fluid is given by

          <p>
            The force on <m>y=y_0</m> is <m>\delta^2p|_{y_0}\bj</m> and that on <m>y=y_0+\delta</m>
            is <m>-\delta^2p|_{y+\delta}\bj</m>. This gives a contribution

              \approx-\delta^3\pd{p}{y}\bj=-V\pd{p}{y}\bj.

            Similarly,
            the force on <m>z=z_0</m> is <m>\delta^2p|_{z_0}\bk</m> and that on <m>z=z_0+\delta</m>

            The unit normal to the face <m>x=x_0</m> is <m>\hat{\bn}=-\bi</m>,

            <me>\tau=\bsigma\hat{\bn}=-p\bI(-\bi)=p\bi.</me>
            Hence the force on this face equals <m>\delta^2p_{x=x_0}\bi</m>.
            Similarly, the unit normal to the face <m>x=x_0+\delta</m> is <m>\hat{\bn}=\bi</m>,
            and hence the stress at a point in this face is
            <me>\tau=\bsigma\hat{\bn}=-p\bI(\bi)=-p\bi.</me>
            Hence the force on this face equals <m>-\delta^2p_{x=x_0+\delta}\bi</m>.

            The contributions from the other faces can be calculated similarly,

            The normal stresses on the two plates are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction,

          <p>
            The shear stresses on the two plates are equal in magnitude and direction,
            indicating that the fluid is exerting the same tangential force on both plates
            in the direction of the flow.
            This is also expected since the plane <m>y=0</m> is a plane of symmetry.

          In this exercise, you will find an expression for force per unit volume acting
          on an incompressible Newtonian fluid.
          You will do this by finding the force acting on a small blob of the fluid
          as an integral over its volume. First you will find a new expression
          for the stress vector at the blob's surface,
          which makes the rest of the calculation easier.
          with normal <m>\hat{\bn}</m>,
          and use this to find an expression for the force on a blob of fluid.

      <title>General deformation of a fluid element</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          <em>Based on Exercise 6.7 in <xref ref="ref-acheson"/>.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          In this exercise, you will consider the general deformation of a fluid element
          in an incompressible Newtonian fluid.
          You will show that the deformation can be expressed as a combination of
          three types of motion: translation, rotation and pure strain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note that, if the fluid were also compressible,
          there would be a fourth type of motion,
          namely expansion or contraction.
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Let <m>P</m> be a point in the fluid with position vector <m>\bx</m>,
            and let <m>Q</m> be a nearby point with position vector <m>\bx+\bs</m>.
            Explain why the velocity at point <m>Q</m> can be expressed in terms
            of that at point <m>P</m> as
            <me>
              \bu_Q=\bu_P+(\bs\cdot\nabla)\bu.
            </me>
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            The velocity at point <m>Q</m> can be expressed as a Taylor series expansion
            about point <m>P</m>:
            <me>
              \bu_Q=\bu_P+\left(\bs\cdot\nabla\right)\bu
              +\frac{1}{2!}\left(\bs\cdot\nabla\right)^2\bu
              +\frac{1}{3!}\left(\bs\cdot\nabla\right)^3\bu+\cdots.
            </me>
            Since <m>Q</m> is a nearby point to <m>P</m>, the higher order terms
            in <m>\bs</m> are negligible, and hence we have

            Note that this example is a special case in which the rotational

      <title>Derivation of the Cauchy equation</title>
      <introduction>
        <p>
          In this problem, you will derive the Cauchy equation
          <xref ref="eqn-cauchy-equation"/> for the conservation of linear momentum
          in an incompressible fluid that is not necessarily Newtonian
          (the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equation only applies to Newtonian fluids).
        </p>
      </introduction>
      <task>
        <statement>
          <p>
            Consider a volume <m>V(t)</m> moving with the fluid that,
            at the time <m>t</m> is the small cube of fluid as shown in
            <xref ref="fig-small-cube"/>, and apply the Reynolds Transport Theorem
            <xref ref="eqn-RTT"/> to the fluid in this volume.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            We consider a volume <m>V</m> with surface <m>S</m>
            consisting of a small cube of side length <m>\delta</m>,
            as shown in <xref ref="fig-small-cube"/>. We apply the
            Reynolds Transport Theorem to the fluid in the cube:
            <me>
              \dd{}{t} \iiint_{V(t)} f \, \de{x} \, \de{y} \, \de{z} = \iiint_{V(t)} \left[
              \pd{f}{t} + \nabla \cdot (f\bu)\right] \, \de{x} \, \de{y} \, \de{z},

            where <m>f</m> is any function, a vector or a scalar.
          </p>
          <p>
            Setting <m>\bf=\rho\bu</m> equal to the momentum per unit volume in the fluid,
            the integral equals the momentum of the fluid in the cube,
            and the time derivative is the rate of change of momentum,
            which is the total force acting on the fluid in the cube.
          </p>
          <p>
            The total force equals the sum of the surface forces and body forces.
            The body force equals the force of gravity: <m>\rho V\bg</m>.
            The surface forces are an integral:

                  Bottom and top faces: The contribution is

                    \delta^3\pd{}{z}\left(\begin{array}{c}

            Hence, the surface force is given by

          </p>
          <p>
            Hence

            Since the cube is small,
            the right-hand side is approximately the volume <m>V</m> times
            the integrand evaluated at a point in <m>V</m>.
            Dividing by <m>V=\delta^3</m> gives

            Since <m>\rho</m> is constant,

            Since the fluid is incompressible, we have <m>\nabla\cdot\bu=0</m>, and,

            We set the coefficients of the two inertial terms equal:

            </me>
            Specify the conditions under which each of these equations is obtained.
            In the latter two cases, we term the equations governing the fluid velocity
            <em>the Stokes equations</em>.
          </p>
        </statement>
        <solution>
          <p>
            In this case, the inertial terms are small compared to the viscous terms,
            so we can neglect them.
            The gravitational acceleration term has order of magnitude <m>\rho L^2g/(\mu U)</m>.
            We need to consider the cases in which this is large, order one or small:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If <m>\rho L^2g/(\mu U)\gg1</m>, the pressre have a predominantly hydrostatic
                  pressure profile, with the fluid dynamical problem being a small perturbation
                  to the background static problem.
                  Thus the pressure gradient balances this term:
                  <me>
                    \frac{LP}{\mu U}=\frac{\rho L^2g}{\mu U}
                    \quad\Rightarrow\quad
                    P=\rho Lg,
                  </me>
                  and, to leading order, the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equation becomes
                  <me>
                    0=-\nabla^* p^*+\hat{\bg}.
                  </me>
                  Once we have solved this problem, we could in principle solve a
                  secondary problem to find the fluid flow. Thus the dimensional problem is
                  <me>
                    0=-\nabla p+\rho\bg.
                  </me>
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If <m>\rho L^2g/(\mu U)</m> is of order 1, the gravitational acceleration
                  term balances the leading-order terms in the equation, and we set
                  <me>
                    \frac{LP}{\mu U}=1\quad\Rightarrow\quad P=\frac{\mu U}{L}.
                  </me>
                  We obtain the leading-order system
                  <me>
                    0=-\nabla^* p^*+\nabla^{*2}\bu^*+\frac{\rho L^2g}{\mu U}\hat{\bg},
                  </me>
                  and redimensionalising, we get
                  <me>
                    0=-\nabla p+\mu\nabla^2\bu,

            Specify the conditions under which each of these equations is obtained.

          <p>
            In this case, the viscous terms are small compared to the inertial terms,
            so we can neglect them.
            Dividing the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equation by <m>\mathrm{Re}</m>,
            <me>
              \DD{\bu^*}{t^*}

            </me>
            The gravitational acceleration term now has order of magnitude <m>Lg/U^2</m>.
            We need to consider the cases in which this is large, order one or small:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  If <m>Lg/U^2\gg1</m>, the pressre have a predominantly hydrostatic
                  pressure profile, with the fluid dynamical problem being a small perturbation
                  to the background static problem.
                  Thus the pressure gradient balances this term:
                  <me>
                    \frac{P}{\rho U^2}=\frac{Lg}{U^2}
                    \quad\Rightarrow\quad
                    P=\rho Lg,
                  </me>
                  and, to leading order, the Navier<ndash/>Stokes equation becomes
                  <me>
                    0=-\nabla^* p^*+\hat{\bg}.
                  </me>
                  As in the low-Reynolds-number cases,
                  once we have solved this problem, we could in principle solve a
                  secondary problem to find the fluid flow. Thus the dimensional problem is
                  <me>
                    0=-\nabla p+\rho\bg.
                  </me>

                  If <m>Lg/U^2</m> is of order 1, the gravitational acceleration

            Initially, there will be a thin boundary layer of fluid close to the cylinder surface
            that starts to rotate with the cylinder due to the no-slip boundary condition.
            As time progresses, viscous diffusion will cause the rotation to spread outwards
            from the cylinder surface into the fluid.
            Eventually, the flow will reach a steady state,
            which is the flow found in the previous part.

          A long cylindrical pipe with slowly varying radius <m>R(z)</m>

          A much narrower cylinder of constant radius <m>a</m> is placed coaxially within

          The narrow cylinder has porous walls and emits fluid

          A fluid flows steadily in the gap between the two cylinders.

            Write down an expression for the Reynolds number of this flow,
            explaining your reasoning.
            You may assume that the pipe
            has length <m>L</m> and that <m>R_0</m> is a typical value of <m>R(z)</m>.

        <!--<solution>
          <p>
            A suitable lengthscale is <m>R_0</m>.
            Simplifying the differential equation for <m>u</m>, by neglecting variations in
            pipe radius <m>R'</m> and the radius of the inner cylinder <m>a</m>, gives
            <me>
              \dd{u}{z} \approx \frac{2aU}{R_0^2},
            </me>
            suggesting a suitable velocity scale is this times <m>L</m>
            (the velocity that would be attained at the end of the pipe):
            <me>
              \frac{2aLU}{R_0^2}.
            </me>
            Hence the Reynolds number is
            <me>
              \mathrm{Re}=\frac{\rho R_0}{\mu}\frac{2aLU}{R_0^2}
              =\frac{2aLU\rho}{\mu R_0}.

            In reality, in a sentence, what would you observe in the flow near the outer wall?

        <!--<solution>
          <p>
            The flow would need to satisfy the no-slip boundary condition at the outer cylinder
            and the velocity there would therefore tend to zero.
