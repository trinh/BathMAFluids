<div class="para">The assumption that the fluid can be described by a smooth scalar density field, <span class="process-math">\(\rho\text{,}\)</span> is a <em class="emphasis">continuum assumption.</em> This is indeed one of the core assumptions that underlies this course, but it is worth noting that this is only an assumption (albeit a widely accepted one, applicable to most real-life scenarios). On the other extreme of this view is the assumption that the fluid is composed of a discrete set of molecules, all bouncing around, and hence fluid dynamics might be posed as the study of the kinetic motion of molecules!<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#rem-continuum-2" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">ðŸ”—</a></div>
</div>
<div class="para">For example, consider the fluid density, <span class="process-math">\(\rho\text{.}\)</span> In the continuum approximation, this needs to be a smooth mathematical function of position and time. We define it at a point <span class="process-math">\(\bx\)</span> by taking a small volume <span class="process-math">\(\delta V\)</span> about <span class="process-math">\(\bx\)</span> and then define <span class="process-math">\(\rho\)</span> as mass of the fluid particles in <span class="process-math">\(\delta V\)</span> divided by <span class="process-math">\(\delta V\text{.}\)</span> But how big should <span class="process-math">\(\delta V\)</span> be? It needs to be big enough that the effects of individual particles will be smoothed out and small enough that the resulting function <span class="process-math">\(\rho\)</span> captures macroscopic density variations in the fluid (which would be averaged out if <span class="process-math">\(\delta V\)</span> is too large).<div class="autopermalink" data-description="Paragraph"><a href="#rem-continuum-3" title="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph" aria-label="Copy heading and permalink for Paragraph">ðŸ”—</a></div>

For volumes much smaller than <span class="process-math">\(10^{-9}\)</span> mm<span class="process-math">\(^3\text{,}\)</span> we can see the effects of individual molecules.
